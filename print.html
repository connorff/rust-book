<p>Welcome to the Rust Book experiment, and thank you for your participation! First, we want to introduce you to the new mechanics of this experiment.</p>
<h2 id="1-quizzes"><a class="header" href="#1-quizzes">1. Quizzes</a></h2>
<p>The main mechanic is <strong>quizzes</strong>: each page has a few quizzes about the page's content We have two rules about quizzes for this experiment:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Take a quiz as soon as you get to it.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do not skip a quiz.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>(We don't enforce these rules, but please follow them!)</p>
<p>Every quiz looks like the one below. Try it out by clicking &quot;Start&quot;.</p>
<div class="quiz-placeholder" data-quiz-name="example-quiz"  data-quiz-questions="{&quot;questions&quot;:[{&quot;context&quot;:&quot;See *Principia Mathematica* for an explanation of this fact.\n&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;MultipleChoice&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;answer&quot;:3},&quot;prompt&quot;:{&quot;choices&quot;:[&quot;0&quot;,&quot;-999&quot;,&quot;11&quot;,&quot;2&quot;],&quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;What is 1 + 1? (Try clicking the wrong answer.)&quot;}}]}"  data-quiz-fullscreen=""  data-quiz-cache-answers="" ></div>
<p>If you get a question incorrect, you can choose to either retry the quiz, or see the correct answers. We encourage you to retry the quiz until you get 100% — feel free to review the content before retrying the quiz. Note that once you see the correct answers, you cannot retry the quiz.</p>
<p>If you spot an issue in a question, you can submit a bug report by clicking the 🐞 icon.</p>
<h2 id="2-highlighting"><a class="header" href="#2-highlighting">2. Highlighting</a></h2>
<p>Another mechanic is <strong>highlighting</strong>: you can select any piece of text, and either highlight it or leave a comment about it. Once you select some text, click the ✏️ button, and leave an optional comment.</p>
<p>👉 Try highlighting this text! 👈</p>
<p>You can use highlights to save information for yourself. You can also use highlights to give us feedback — for example, if you think a section of content is confusing, you can let us know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> your highlights will disappear if we change the content that you've highlighted. Also, your highlights are stored as a cookie. If you block cookies or change browsers, then you won't see your previous highlights.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="3-and-more"><a class="header" href="#3-and-more">3. ...and more!</a></h2>
<p>The book's content may change as you go through the experiment. We will update this page as we add new features.</p>

<p>It wasn’t always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally
about <em>empowerment</em>: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust
empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of
domains than you did before.</p>
<p>Take, for example, “systems-level” work that deals with low-level details of
memory management, data representation, and concurrency. Traditionally, this
realm of programming is seen as arcane, accessible only to a select few who
have devoted the necessary years learning to avoid its infamous pitfalls. And
even those who practice it do so with caution, lest their code be open to
exploits, crashes, or corruption.</p>
<p>Rust breaks down these barriers by eliminating the old pitfalls and providing a
friendly, polished set of tools to help you along the way. Programmers who need
to “dip down” into lower-level control can do so with Rust, without taking on
the customary risk of crashes or security holes, and without having to learn
the fine points of a fickle toolchain. Better yet, the language is designed to
guide you naturally towards reliable code that is efficient in terms of speed
and memory usage.</p>
<p>Programmers who are already working with low-level code can use Rust to raise
their ambitions. For example, introducing parallelism in Rust is a relatively
low-risk operation: the compiler will catch the classical mistakes for you. And
you can tackle more aggressive optimizations in your code with the confidence
that you won’t accidentally introduce crashes or vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>But Rust isn’t limited to low-level systems programming. It’s expressive and
ergonomic enough to make CLI apps, web servers, and many other kinds of code
quite pleasant to write — you’ll find simple examples of both later in the
book. Working with Rust allows you to build skills that transfer from one
domain to another; you can learn Rust by writing a web app, then apply those
same skills to target your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>This book fully embraces the potential of Rust to empower its users. It’s a
friendly and approachable text intended to help you level up not just your
knowledge of Rust, but also your reach and confidence as a programmer in
general. So dive in, get ready to learn—and welcome to the Rust community!</p>

<p>Welcome to <em>The Rust Programming Language</em>, an introductory book about Rust.
The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software.
High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming
language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful
technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option
to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle
traditionally associated with such control.</p>
<h2 id="who-rust-is-for"><a class="header" href="#who-rust-is-for">Who Rust Is For</a></h2>
<p>Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let’s look at a few of
the most important groups.</p>
<h3 id="teams-of-developers"><a class="header" href="#teams-of-developers">Teams of Developers</a></h3>
<p>Rust is proving to be a productive tool for collaborating among large teams of
developers with varying levels of systems programming knowledge. Low-level code
is prone to a variety of subtle bugs, which in most other languages can be
caught only through extensive testing and careful code review by experienced
developers. In Rust, the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to
compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs. By working
alongside the compiler, the team can spend their time focusing on the program’s
logic rather than chasing down bugs.</p>
<p>Rust also brings contemporary developer tools to the systems programming world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes adding,
compiling, and managing dependencies painless and consistent across the Rust
ecosystem.</li>
<li>Rustfmt ensures a consistent coding style across developers.</li>
<li>The Rust Language Server powers Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
integration for code completion and inline error messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using these and other tools in the Rust ecosystem, developers can be
productive while writing systems-level code.</p>
<h3 id="students"><a class="header" href="#students">Students</a></h3>
<p>Rust is for students and those who are interested in learning about systems
concepts. Using Rust, many people have learned about topics like operating
systems development. The community is very welcoming and happy to answer
student questions. Through efforts such as this book, the Rust teams want to
make systems concepts more accessible to more people, especially those new to
programming.</p>
<h3 id="companies"><a class="header" href="#companies">Companies</a></h3>
<p>Hundreds of companies, large and small, use Rust in production for a variety of
tasks. Those tasks include command line tools, web services, DevOps tooling,
embedded devices, audio and video analysis and transcoding, cryptocurrencies,
bioinformatics, search engines, Internet of Things applications, machine
learning, and even major parts of the Firefox web browser.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-developers"><a class="header" href="#open-source-developers">Open Source Developers</a></h3>
<p>Rust is for people who want to build the Rust programming language, community,
developer tools, and libraries. We’d love to have you contribute to the Rust
language.</p>
<h3 id="people-who-value-speed-and-stability"><a class="header" href="#people-who-value-speed-and-stability">People Who Value Speed and Stability</a></h3>
<p>Rust is for people who crave speed and stability in a language. By speed, we
mean the speed of the programs that you can create with Rust and the speed at
which Rust lets you write them. The Rust compiler’s checks ensure stability
through feature additions and refactoring. This is in contrast to the brittle
legacy code in languages without these checks, which developers are often
afraid to modify. By striving for zero-cost abstractions, higher-level features
that compile to lower-level code as fast as code written manually, Rust
endeavors to make safe code be fast code as well.</p>
<p>The Rust language hopes to support many other users as well; those mentioned
here are merely some of the biggest stakeholders. Overall, Rust’s greatest
ambition is to eliminate the trade-offs that programmers have accepted for
decades by providing safety <em>and</em> productivity, speed <em>and</em> ergonomics. Give
Rust a try and see if its choices work for you.</p>
<h2 id="who-this-book-is-for"><a class="header" href="#who-this-book-is-for">Who This Book Is For</a></h2>
<p>This book assumes that you’ve written code in another programming language but
doesn’t make any assumptions about which one. We’ve tried to make the material
broadly accessible to those from a wide variety of programming backgrounds. We
don’t spend a lot of time talking about what programming <em>is</em> or how to think
about it. If you’re entirely new to programming, you would be better served by
reading a book that specifically provides an introduction to programming.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-book"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-this-book">How to Use This Book</a></h2>
<p>In general, this book assumes that you’re reading it in sequence from front to
back. Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier
chapters might not delve into details on a topic; we typically revisit the
topic in a later chapter.</p>
<p>You’ll find two kinds of chapters in this book: concept chapters and project
chapters. In concept chapters, you’ll learn about an aspect of Rust. In project
chapters, we’ll build small programs together, applying what you’ve learned so
far. Chapters 2, 12, and 20 are project chapters; the rest are concept chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 explains how to install Rust, how to write a “Hello, world!” program,
and how to use Cargo, Rust’s package manager and build tool. Chapter 2 is a
hands-on introduction to the Rust language. Here we cover concepts at a high
level, and later chapters will provide additional detail. If you want to get
your hands dirty right away, Chapter 2 is the place for that. At first, you
might even want to skip Chapter 3, which covers Rust features similar to those
of other programming languages, and head straight to Chapter 4 to learn about
Rust’s ownership system. However, if you’re a particularly meticulous learner
who prefers to learn every detail before moving on to the next, you might want
to skip Chapter 2 and go straight to Chapter 3, returning to Chapter 2 when
you’d like to work on a project applying the details you’ve learned.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 discusses structs and methods, and Chapter 6 covers enums, <code>match</code>
expressions, and the <code>if let</code> control flow construct. You’ll use structs and
enums to make custom types in Rust.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7, you’ll learn about Rust’s module system and about privacy rules
for organizing your code and its public Application Programming Interface
(API). Chapter 8 discusses some common collection data structures that the
standard library provides, such as vectors, strings, and hash maps. Chapter 9
explores Rust’s error-handling philosophy and techniques.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 digs into generics, traits, and lifetimes, which give you the power
to define code that applies to multiple types. Chapter 11 is all about testing,
which even with Rust’s safety guarantees is necessary to ensure your program’s
logic is correct. In Chapter 12, we’ll build our own implementation of a subset
of functionality from the <code>grep</code> command line tool that searches for text
within files. For this, we’ll use many of the concepts we discussed in the
previous chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 explores closures and iterators: features of Rust that come from
functional programming languages. In Chapter 14, we’ll examine Cargo in more
depth and talk about best practices for sharing your libraries with others.
Chapter 15 discusses smart pointers that the standard library provides and the
traits that enable their functionality.</p>
<p>In Chapter 16, we’ll walk through different models of concurrent programming
and talk about how Rust helps you to program in multiple threads fearlessly.
Chapter 17 looks at how Rust idioms compare to object-oriented programming
principles you might be familiar with.</p>
<p>Chapter 18 is a reference on patterns and pattern matching, which are powerful
ways of expressing ideas throughout Rust programs. Chapter 19 contains a
smorgasbord of advanced topics of interest, including unsafe Rust, macros, and
more about lifetimes, traits, types, functions, and closures.</p>
<p>In Chapter 20, we’ll complete a project in which we’ll implement a low-level
multithreaded web server!</p>
<p>Finally, some appendices contain useful information about the language in a
more reference-like format. Appendix A covers Rust’s keywords, Appendix B
covers Rust’s operators and symbols, Appendix C covers derivable traits
provided by the standard library, Appendix D covers some useful development
tools, and Appendix E explains Rust editions. In Appendix F, you can find
translations of the book, and in Appendix G we’ll cover how Rust is made and
what nightly Rust is.</p>
<p>There is no wrong way to read this book: if you want to skip ahead, go for it!
You might have to jump back to earlier chapters if you experience any
confusion. But do whatever works for you.</p>
<p><span id="ferris"></span></p>
<p>An important part of the process of learning Rust is learning how to read the
error messages the compiler displays: these will guide you toward working code.
As such, we’ll provide many examples that don’t compile along with the error
message the compiler will show you in each situation. Know that if you enter
and run a random example, it may not compile! Make sure you read the
surrounding text to see whether the example you’re trying to run is meant to
error. Ferris will also help you distinguish code that isn’t meant to work:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Ferris</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><img src="img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg" class="ferris-explain" alt="Ferris with a question mark"/></td><td>This code does not compile!</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="img/ferris/panics.svg" class="ferris-explain" alt="Ferris throwing up their hands"/></td><td>This code panics!</td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="img/ferris/not_desired_behavior.svg" class="ferris-explain" alt="Ferris with one claw up, shrugging"/></td><td>This code does not produce the desired behavior.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>In most situations, we’ll lead you to the correct version of any code that
doesn’t compile.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="getting-started"><a class="header" href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a></h1>
<p>Let’s start your Rust journey! There’s a lot to learn, but every journey starts
somewhere. In this chapter, we’ll discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing Rust on Linux, macOS, and Windows</li>
<li>Writing a program that prints <code>Hello, world!</code></li>
<li>Using <code>cargo</code>, Rust’s package manager and build system</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="installation"><a class="header" href="#installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>The first step is to install Rust. We’ll download Rust through <code>rustup</code>, a
command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools. You’ll need
an internet connection for the download.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you prefer not to use <code>rustup</code> for some reason, please see the
<a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html">Other Rust Installation Methods page</a> for more options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust compiler.
Rust’s stability guarantees ensure that all the examples in the book that
compile will continue to compile with newer Rust versions. The output might
differ slightly between versions, because Rust often improves error messages
and warnings. In other words, any newer, stable version of Rust you install
using these steps should work as expected with the content of this book.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="command-line-notation"><a class="header" href="#command-line-notation">Command Line Notation</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter and throughout the book, we’ll show some commands used in the
terminal. Lines that you should enter in a terminal all start with <code>$</code>. You
don’t need to type in the <code>$</code> character; it’s the command line prompt shown
to indicate the start of each command. Lines that don’t start with <code>$</code>
typically show the output of the previous command. Additionally,
PowerShell-specific examples will use <code>&gt;</code> rather than <code>$</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="installing-rustup-on-linux-or-macos"><a class="header" href="#installing-rustup-on-linux-or-macos">Installing <code>rustup</code> on Linux or macOS</a></h3>
<p>If you’re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
</code></pre>
<p>The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the <code>rustup</code>
tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust. You might be prompted
for your password. If the install is successful, the following line will appear:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Rust is installed now. Great!
</code></pre>
<p>You will also need a <em>linker</em>, which is a program that Rust uses to join its
compiled outputs into one file. It is likely you already have one. If you get
linker errors, you should install a C compiler, which will typically include a
linker. A C compiler is also useful because some common Rust packages depend on
C code and will need a C compiler.</p>
<p>On macOS, you can get a C compiler by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ xcode-select --install
</code></pre>
<p>Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their
distribution’s documentation. For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can install
the <code>build-essential</code> package.</p>
<h3 id="installing-rustup-on-windows"><a class="header" href="#installing-rustup-on-windows">Installing <code>rustup</code> on Windows</a></h3>
<p>On Windows, go to <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install</a> and follow
the instructions for installing Rust. At some point in the installation, you’ll
receive a message explaining that you’ll also need the MSVC build tools for
Visual Studio 2013 or later. To acquire the build tools, you’ll need to install
<a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2022</a>. When asked which workloads to install,
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Desktop Development with C++”</li>
<li>The Windows 10 or 11 SDK</li>
<li>The English language pack component, along with any other language pack of
your choosing</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of this book uses commands that work in both <em>cmd.exe</em> and PowerShell.
If there are specific differences, we’ll explain which to use.</p>
<h3 id="troubleshooting"><a class="header" href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h3>
<p>To check whether you have Rust installed correctly, open a shell and enter this
line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustc --version
</code></pre>
<p>You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date for the latest
stable version that has been released in the following format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)
</code></pre>
<p>If you see this information, you have installed Rust successfully! If you don’t
see this information, check that Rust is in your <code>%PATH%</code>
system variable as follows.</p>
<p>In Windows CMD, use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt; echo %PATH%
</code></pre>
<p>In PowerShell, use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt; echo $env:Path
</code></pre>
<p>In Linux and macOS, use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">echo $PATH
</code></pre>
<p>If that’s all correct and Rust still isn’t working, there are a number of
places you can get help. The easiest is the #beginners channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/rust-lang">the official
Rust Discord</a>. There, you can chat with other Rustaceans (a silly
nickname we call ourselves) who can help you out. Other great resources include
<a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/">the Users forum</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
<h3 id="updating-and-uninstalling"><a class="header" href="#updating-and-uninstalling">Updating and Uninstalling</a></h3>
<p>Once Rust is installed via <code>rustup</code>, when a new version of Rust is released,
updating to the latest version is easy. From your shell, run the following
update script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustup update
</code></pre>
<p>To uninstall Rust and <code>rustup</code>, run the following uninstall script from your
shell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustup self uninstall
</code></pre>
<h3 id="local-documentation"><a class="header" href="#local-documentation">Local Documentation</a></h3>
<p>The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation, so
you can read it offline. Run <code>rustup doc</code> to open the local documentation in
your browser.</p>
<p>Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and you’re not
sure what it does or how to use it, use the application programming interface
(API) documentation to find out!</p>

<p>Now that you’ve installed Rust, let’s write your first Rust program. It’s
traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that prints
the text <code>Hello, world!</code> to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This book assumes basic familiarity with the command line. Rust makes
no specific demands about your editing or tooling or where your code lives, so
if you prefer to use an integrated development environment (IDE) instead of
the command line, feel free to use your favorite IDE. Many IDEs now have some
degree of Rust support; check the IDE’s documentation for details. The Rust
team has been focusing on enabling great IDE support via <code>rust-analyzer</code>. See
<a href="appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html">Appendix D</a><!-- ignore --> for more details!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="creating-a-project-directory"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-project-directory">Creating a Project Directory</a></h3>
<p>You’ll start by making a directory to store your Rust code. It doesn’t matter
to Rust where your code lives, but for the exercises and projects in this book,
we suggest making a <em>projects</em> directory in your home directory and keeping all
your projects there.</p>
<p>Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make a <em>projects</em> directory
and a directory for the “Hello, world!” project within the <em>projects</em> directory.</p>
<p>For Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, enter this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
</code></pre>
<p>For Windows CMD, enter this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt; mkdir &quot;%USERPROFILE%\projects&quot;
&gt; cd /d &quot;%USERPROFILE%\projects&quot;
&gt; mkdir hello_world
&gt; cd hello_world
</code></pre>
<h3 id="writing-and-running-a-rust-program"><a class="header" href="#writing-and-running-a-rust-program">Writing and Running a Rust Program</a></h3>
<p>Next, make a new source file and call it <em>main.rs</em>. Rust files always end with
the <em>.rs</em> extension. If you’re using more than one word in your filename, the
convention is to use an underscore to separate them. For example, use
<em>hello_world.rs</em> rather than <em>helloworld.rs</em>.</p>
<p>Now open the <em>main.rs</em> file you just created and enter the code in Listing 1-1.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 1-1: A program that prints <code>Hello, world!</code></span></p>
<p>Save the file and go back to your terminal window in the
<em>~/projects/hello_world</em> directory. On Linux or macOS, enter the following
commands to compile and run the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>On Windows, enter the command <code>.\main.exe</code> instead of <code>./main</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">&gt; rustc main.rs
&gt; .\main.exe
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Regardless of your operating system, the string <code>Hello, world!</code> should print to
the terminal. If you don’t see this output, refer back to the
<a href="ch01-01-installation.html#troubleshooting">“Troubleshooting”</a><!-- ignore --> part of the Installation
section for ways to get help.</p>
<p>If <code>Hello, world!</code> did print, congratulations! You’ve officially written a Rust
program. That makes you a Rust programmer—welcome!</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-a-rust-program"><a class="header" href="#anatomy-of-a-rust-program">Anatomy of a Rust Program</a></h3>
<p>Let’s review this “Hello, world!” program in detail. Here’s the first piece of
the puzzle:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {

}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>These lines define a function named <code>main</code>. The <code>main</code> function is special: it
is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program. Here, the
first line declares a function named <code>main</code> that has no parameters and returns
nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>The function body is wrapped in <code>{}</code>. Rust requires curly brackets around all
function bodies. It’s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same
line as the function declaration, adding one space in between.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, you can
use an automatic formatter tool called <code>rustfmt</code> to format your code in a
particular style (more on <code>rustfmt</code> in
<a href="appendix-04-useful-development-tools.html">Appendix D</a><!-- ignore -->). The Rust team has included this tool
with the standard Rust distribution, like <code>rustc</code>, so it should already be
installed on your computer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The body of the <code>main</code> function holds the following code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This line does all the work in this little program: it prints text to the
screen. There are four important details to notice here.</p>
<p>First, Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.</p>
<p>Second, <code>println!</code> calls a Rust macro. If it had called a function instead, it
would be entered as <code>println</code> (without the <code>!</code>). We’ll discuss Rust macros in
more detail in Chapter 19. For now, you just need to know that using a <code>!</code>
means that you’re calling a macro instead of a normal function, and that macros
don’t always follow the same rules as functions.</p>
<p>Third, you see the <code>&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</code> string. We pass this string as an argument
to <code>println!</code>, and the string is printed to the screen.</p>
<p>Fourth, we end the line with a semicolon (<code>;</code>), which indicates that this
expression is over and the next one is ready to begin. Most lines of Rust code
end with a semicolon.</p>
<h3 id="compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps"><a class="header" href="#compiling-and-running-are-separate-steps">Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps</a></h3>
<p>You’ve just run a newly created program, so let’s examine each step in the
process.</p>
<p>Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler by
entering the <code>rustc</code> command and passing it the name of your source file, like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustc main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>If you have a C or C++ background, you’ll notice that this is similar to <code>gcc</code>
or <code>clang</code>. After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable.</p>
<p>On Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, you can see the executable by
entering the <code>ls</code> command in your shell. On Linux and macOS, you’ll see two
files. With PowerShell on Windows, you’ll see the same three files that you
would see using CMD.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ls
main  main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>With CMD on Windows, you would enter the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt; dir /B %= the /B option says to only show the file names =%
main.exe
main.pdb
main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This shows the source code file with the <em>.rs</em> extension, the executable file
(<em>main.exe</em> on Windows, but <em>main</em> on all other platforms), and, when using
Windows, a file containing debugging information with the <em>.pdb</em> extension.
From here, you run the <em>main</em> or <em>main.exe</em> file, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ./main # or .\main.exe on Windows
</code></pre>
<p>If your <em>main.rs</em> is your “Hello, world!” program, this line prints <code>Hello, world!</code> to your terminal.</p>
<p>If you’re more familiar with a dynamic language, such as Ruby, Python, or
JavaScript, you might not be used to compiling and running a program as
separate steps. Rust is an <em>ahead-of-time compiled</em> language, meaning you can
compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it
even without having Rust installed. If you give someone a <em>.rb</em>, <em>.py</em>, or
<em>.js</em> file, they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation
installed (respectively). But in those languages, you only need one command to
compile and run your program. Everything is a trade-off in language design.</p>
<p>Just compiling with <code>rustc</code> is fine for simple programs, but as your project
grows, you’ll want to manage all the options and make it easy to share your

<p>Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this tool
to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you,
such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and
building those libraries. (We call the libraries that your code needs
<em>dependencies</em>.)</p>
<p>The simplest Rust programs, like the one we’ve written so far, don’t have any
dependencies. If we had built the “Hello, world!” project with Cargo, it would
only use the part of Cargo that handles building your code. As you write more
complex Rust programs, you’ll add dependencies, and if you start a project
using Cargo, adding dependencies will be much easier to do.</p>
<p>Because the vast majority of Rust projects use Cargo, the rest of this book
assumes that you’re using Cargo too. Cargo comes installed with Rust if you
used the official installers discussed in the
<a href="ch01-01-installation.html#installation">“Installation”</a><!-- ignore --> section. If you installed Rust
through some other means, check whether Cargo is installed by entering the
following into your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo --version
</code></pre>
<p>If you see a version number, you have it! If you see an error, such as <code>command not found</code>, look at the documentation for your method of installation to
determine how to install Cargo separately.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-project-with-cargo"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-project-with-cargo">Creating a Project with Cargo</a></h3>
<p>Let’s create a new project using Cargo and look at how it differs from our
original “Hello, world!” project. Navigate back to your <em>projects</em> directory (or
wherever you decided to store your code). Then, on any operating system, run
the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new hello_cargo
$ cd hello_cargo
</code></pre>
<p>The first command creates a new directory and project called <em>hello_cargo</em>.
We’ve named our project <em>hello_cargo</em>, and Cargo creates its files in a
directory of the same name.</p>
<p>Go into the <em>hello_cargo</em> directory and list the files. You’ll see that Cargo
has generated two files and one directory for us: a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file and a
<em>src</em> directory with a <em>main.rs</em> file inside.</p>
<p>It has also initialized a new Git repository along with a <em>.gitignore</em> file.
Git files won’t be generated if you run <code>cargo new</code> within an existing Git
repository; you can override this behavior by using <code>cargo new --vcs=git</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Git is a common version control system. You can change <code>cargo new</code> to
use a different version control system or no version control system by using
the <code>--vcs</code> flag. Run <code>cargo new --help</code> to see the available options.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open <em>Cargo.toml</em> in your text editor of choice. It should look similar to the
code in Listing 1-2.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package]
name = &quot;hello_cargo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2021&quot;

[dependencies]
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 1-2: Contents of <em>Cargo.toml</em> generated by <code>cargo new</code></span></p>
<p>This file is in the <a href="https://toml.io"><em>TOML</em></a><!-- ignore --> (<em>Tom’s Obvious,
Minimal Language</em>) format, which is Cargo’s configuration format.</p>
<p>The first line, <code>[package]</code>, is a section heading that indicates that the
following statements are configuring a package. As we add more information to
this file, we’ll add other sections.</p>
<p>The next three lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to compile
your program: the name, the version, and the edition of Rust to use. We’ll talk
about the <code>edition</code> key in <a href="appendix-05-editions.html">Appendix E</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>
<p>The last line, <code>[dependencies]</code>, is the start of a section for you to list any
of your project’s dependencies. In Rust, packages of code are referred to as
<em>crates</em>. We won’t need any other crates for this project, but we will in the
first project in Chapter 2, so we’ll use this dependencies section then.</p>
<p>Now open <em>src/main.rs</em> and take a look:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Cargo has generated a “Hello, world!” program for you, just like the one we
wrote in Listing 1-1! So far, the differences between our project and the
project Cargo generated are that Cargo placed the code in the <em>src</em> directory,
and we have a <em>Cargo.toml</em> configuration file in the top directory.</p>
<p>Cargo expects your source files to live inside the <em>src</em> directory. The
top-level project directory is just for README files, license information,
configuration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo
helps you organize your projects. There’s a place for everything, and
everything is in its place.</p>
<p>If you started a project that doesn’t use Cargo, as we did with the “Hello,
world!” project, you can convert it to a project that does use Cargo. Move the
project code into the <em>src</em> directory and create an appropriate <em>Cargo.toml</em>
file.</p>
<h3 id="building-and-running-a-cargo-project"><a class="header" href="#building-and-running-a-cargo-project">Building and Running a Cargo Project</a></h3>
<p>Now let’s look at what’s different when we build and run the “Hello, world!”
program with Cargo! From your <em>hello_cargo</em> directory, build your project by
entering the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo build
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.85 secs
</code></pre>
<p>This command creates an executable file in <em>target/debug/hello_cargo</em> (or
<em>target\debug\hello_cargo.exe</em> on Windows) rather than in your current
directory. Because the default build is a debug build, Cargo puts the binary in
a directory named <em>debug</em>. You can run the executable with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo # or .\target\debug\hello_cargo.exe on Windows
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>If all goes well, <code>Hello, world!</code> should print to the terminal. Running <code>cargo build</code> for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top
level: <em>Cargo.lock</em>. This file keeps track of the exact versions of
dependencies in your project. This project doesn’t have dependencies, so the
file is a bit sparse. You won’t ever need to change this file manually; Cargo
manages its contents for you.</p>
<p>We just built a project with <code>cargo build</code> and ran it with
<code>./target/debug/hello_cargo</code>, but we can also use <code>cargo run</code> to compile the
code and then run the resulting executable all in one command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>cargo run</code> is more convenient than having to remember to run <code>cargo build</code> and then use the whole path to the binary, so most developers use <code>cargo run</code>.</p>
<p>Notice that this time we didn’t see output indicating that Cargo was compiling
<code>hello_cargo</code>. Cargo figured out that the files hadn’t changed, so it didn’t
rebuild but just ran the binary. If you had modified your source code, Cargo
would have rebuilt the project before running it, and you would have seen this
output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33 secs
     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo also provides a command called <code>cargo check</code>. This command quickly checks
your code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t produce an executable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo check
   Checking hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs
</code></pre>
<p>Why would you not want an executable? Often, <code>cargo check</code> is much faster than
<code>cargo build</code>, because it skips the step of producing an executable. If you’re
continually checking your work while writing the code, using <code>cargo check</code> will
speed up the process of letting you know if your project is still compiling! As
such, many Rustaceans run <code>cargo check</code> periodically as they write their
program to make sure it compiles. Then they run <code>cargo build</code> when they’re
ready to use the executable.</p>
<p>Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far about Cargo:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can create a project using <code>cargo new</code>.</li>
<li>We can build a project using <code>cargo build</code>.</li>
<li>We can build and run a project in one step using <code>cargo run</code>.</li>
<li>We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using
<code>cargo check</code>.</li>
<li>Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code,
Cargo stores it in the <em>target/debug</em> directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no
matter which operating system you’re working on. So, at this point, we’ll no
longer provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.</p>
<h3 id="building-for-release"><a class="header" href="#building-for-release">Building for Release</a></h3>
<p>When your project is finally ready for release, you can use <code>cargo build --release</code> to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an
executable in <em>target/release</em> instead of <em>target/debug</em>. The optimizations
make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes
for your program to compile. This is why there are two different profiles: one
for development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for
building the final program you’ll give to a user that won’t be rebuilt
repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you’re benchmarking your
code’s running time, be sure to run <code>cargo build --release</code> and benchmark with
the executable in <em>target/release</em>.</p>
<h3 id="cargo-as-convention"><a class="header" href="#cargo-as-convention">Cargo as Convention</a></h3>
<p>With simple projects, Cargo doesn’t provide a lot of value over just using
<code>rustc</code>, but it will prove its worth as your programs become more intricate.
Once programs grow to multiple files or need a dependency, it’s much easier to
let Cargo coordinate the build.</p>
<p>Even though the <code>hello_cargo</code> project is simple, it now uses much of the real
tooling you’ll use in the rest of your Rust career. In fact, to work on any
existing projects, you can use the following commands to check out the code
using Git, change to that project’s directory, and build:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ git clone example.org/someproject
$ cd someproject
$ cargo build
</code></pre>

<p>You’re already off to a great start on your Rust journey! In this chapter,
you’ve learned how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the latest stable version of Rust using <code>rustup</code></li>
<li>Update to a newer Rust version</li>
<li>Open locally installed documentation</li>
<li>Write and run a “Hello, world!” program using <code>rustc</code> directly</li>
<li>Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great time to build a more substantial program to get used to reading
and writing Rust code. So, in Chapter 2, we’ll build a guessing game program.
If you would rather start by learning how common programming concepts work in
Rust, see Chapter 3 and then return to Chapter 2.</p>

<p>Let’s jump into Rust by working through a hands-on project together! This
chapter introduces you to a few common Rust concepts by showing you how to use
them in a real program. You’ll learn about <code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, methods, associated
functions, using external crates, and more! In the following chapters, we’ll
explore these ideas in more detail. In this chapter, you’ll practice the
fundamentals.</p>
<p>We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here’s
how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It
will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the
program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is
correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-a-new-project"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-a-new-project">Setting Up a New Project</a></h2>
<p>To set up a new project, go to the <em>projects</em> directory that you created in
Chapter 1 and make a new project using Cargo, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new guessing_game
$ cd guessing_game
</code></pre>
<p>The first command, <code>cargo new</code>, takes the name of the project (<code>guessing_game</code>)
as the first argument. The second command changes to the new project’s
directory.</p>
<p>Look at the generated <em>Cargo.toml</em> file:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch02-guessing-game-tutorial

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

</code></pre>
<p>As you saw in Chapter 1, <code>cargo new</code> generates a “Hello, world!” program for
you. Check out the <em>src/main.rs</em> file:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Now let’s compile this “Hello, world!” program and run it in the same step
using the <code>cargo run</code> command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.50s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>run</code> command comes in handy when you need to rapidly iterate on a project,
as we’ll do in this game, quickly testing each iteration before moving on to
the next one.</p>
<p>Reopen the <em>src/main.rs</em> file. You’ll be writing all the code in this file.</p>
<h2 id="processing-a-guess"><a class="header" href="#processing-a-guess">Processing a Guess</a></h2>
<p>The first part of the guessing game program will ask for user input, process
that input, and check that the input is in the expected form. To start, we’ll
allow the player to input a guess. Enter the code in Listing 2-1 into
<em>src/main.rs</em>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-1: Code that gets a guess from the user and
prints it</span></p>
<p>This code contains a lot of information, so let’s go over it line by line. To
obtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the
<code>io</code> input/output library into scope. The <code>io</code> library comes from the
standard library, known as <code>std</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::io;
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let mut guess = String::new();
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
</span><span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings
into the scope of every program. This set is called the <em>prelude</em>, and you can
see everything in it <a href="../std/prelude/index.html">in the standard library documentation</a>.</p>
<p>If a type you want to use isn’t in the prelude, you have to bring that type
into scope explicitly with a <code>use</code> statement. Using the <code>std::io</code> library
provides you with a number of useful features, including the ability to accept
user input.</p>
<p>As you saw in Chapter 1, the <code>main</code> function is the entry point into the
program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn main() {
<span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let mut guess = String::new();
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
</span><span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>fn</code> syntax declares a new function, the parentheses, <code>()</code>, indicate there
are no parameters, and the curly bracket, <code>{</code>, starts the body of the function.</p>
<p>As you also learned in Chapter 1, <code>println!</code> is a macro that prints a string to
the screen:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let mut guess = String::new();
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
</span><span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This code is printing a prompt stating what the game is and requesting input
from the user.</p>
<h3 id="storing-values-with-variables"><a class="header" href="#storing-values-with-variables">Storing Values with Variables</a></h3>
<p>Next, we’ll create a <em>variable</em> to store the user input, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    let mut guess = String::new();
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    io::stdin()
</span><span class="boring">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
</span><span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now the program is getting interesting! There’s a lot going on in this little
line. We use the <code>let</code> statement to create the variable. Here’s another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let apples = 5;
</code></pre>
<p>This line creates a new variable named <code>apples</code> and binds it to the value 5. In
Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable a
value, the value won't change. We’ll be discussing this concept in detail in
the <a href="ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#variables-and-mutability">“Variables and Mutability”</a><!-- ignore -->
section in Chapter 3. To make a variable mutable, we add <code>mut</code> before the
variable name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let apples = 5; // immutable
let mut bananas = 5; // mutable
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The <code>//</code> syntax starts a comment that continues until the end of the
line. Rust ignores everything in comments. We’ll discuss comments in more
detail in <a href="ch03-04-comments.html">Chapter 3</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Returning to the guessing game program, you now know that <code>let mut guess</code> will
introduce a mutable variable named <code>guess</code>. The equal sign (<code>=</code>) tells Rust we
want to bind something to the variable now. On the right of the equals sign is
the value that <code>guess</code> is bound to, which is the result of calling
<code>String::new</code>, a function that returns a new instance of a <code>String</code>.
<a href="../std/string/struct.String.html"><code>String</code></a><!-- ignore --> is a string type provided by the standard
library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.</p>
<p>The <code>::</code> syntax in the <code>::new</code> line indicates that <code>new</code> is an associated
function of the <code>String</code> type. An <em>associated function</em> is a function that’s
implemented on a type, in this case <code>String</code>. This <code>new</code> function creates a
new, empty string. You’ll find a <code>new</code> function on many types, because it’s a
common name for a function that makes a new value of some kind.</p>
<p>In full, the <code>let mut guess = String::new();</code> line has created a mutable
variable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a <code>String</code>. Whew!</p>
<h3 id="receiving-user-input"><a class="header" href="#receiving-user-input">Receiving User Input</a></h3>
<p>Recall that we included the input/output functionality from the standard
library with <code>use std::io;</code> on the first line of the program. Now we’ll call
the <code>stdin</code> function from the <code>io</code> module, which will allow us to handle user
input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">

<p>If we hadn’t imported the <code>io</code> library with <code>use std::io</code> at the beginning of
the program, we could still use the function by writing this function call as
<code>std::io::stdin</code>. The <code>stdin</code> function returns an instance of
<a href="../std/io/struct.Stdin.html"><code>std::io::Stdin</code></a><!-- ignore -->, which is a type that represents a
handle to the standard input for your terminal.</p>
<p>Next, the line <code>.read_line(&amp;mut guess)</code> calls the <a href="../std/io/struct.Stdin.html#method.read_line"><code>read_line</code></a><!--
ignore --> method on the standard input handle to get input from the user.
We’re also passing <code>&amp;mut guess</code> as the argument to <code>read_line</code> to tell it what
string to store the user input in. The full job of <code>read_line</code> is to take
whatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string
(without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that string as an
argument. The string argument needs to be mutable so the method can change the
string’s content.</p>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> indicates that this argument is a <em>reference</em>, which gives you a way to
let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to
copy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature,
and one of Rust’s major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use
references. You don’t need to know a lot of those details to finish this
program. For now, all you need to know is that like variables, references are
immutable by default. Hence, you need to write <code>&amp;mut guess</code> rather than
<code>&amp;guess</code> to make it mutable. (Chapter 4 will explain references more
thoroughly.)</p>

<p>We’re still working on this line of code. We’re now discussing a third line of
text, but note that it’s still part of a single logical line of code. The next
part is this method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We could have written this code as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut guess).expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>However, one long line is difficult to read, so it’s best to divide it. It’s
often wise to introduce a newline and other whitespace to help break up long
lines when you call a method with the <code>.method_name()</code> syntax. Now let’s
discuss what this line does.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, <code>read_line</code> puts whatever the user enters into the string
we pass to it, but it also returns a <code>Result</code> value. <a href="../std/result/enum.Result.html"><code>Result</code></a><!--
ignore --> is an <a href="ch06-00-enums.html"><em>enumeration</em></a><!-- ignore -->, often called an <em>enum</em>,
which is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each
possible state a <em>variant</em>.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 will cover enums in more detail. The purpose of these <code>Result</code> types
is to encode error-handling information.</p>
<p><code>Result</code>'s variants are <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. The <code>Ok</code> variant indicates the
operation was successful, and inside <code>Ok</code> is the successfully generated value.
The <code>Err</code> variant means the operation failed, and <code>Err</code> contains information
about how or why the operation failed.</p>
<p>Values of the <code>Result</code> type, like values of any type, have methods defined on
them. An instance of <code>Result</code> has an <a href="../std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect"><code>expect</code> method</a><!-- ignore -->
that you can call. If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Err</code> value, <code>expect</code>
will cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an
argument to <code>expect</code>. If the <code>read_line</code> method returns an <code>Err</code>, it would
likely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system.
If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code> value, <code>expect</code> will take the return
value that <code>Ok</code> is holding and return just that value to you so you can use it.
In this case, that value is the number of bytes in the user’s input.</p>
<p>If you don’t call <code>expect</code>, the program will compile, but you’ll get a warning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo build

<p>Rust warns that you haven’t used the <code>Result</code> value returned from <code>read_line</code>,
indicating that the program hasn’t handled a possible error.</p>
<p>The right way to suppress the warning is to actually write error handling, but
in our case we just want to crash this program when a problem occurs, so we can
use <code>expect</code>. You’ll learn about recovering from errors in <a href="ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">Chapter

<h3 id="printing-values-with-println-placeholders"><a class="header" href="#printing-values-with-println-placeholders">Printing Values with <code>println!</code> Placeholders</a></h3>
<p>Aside from the closing curly bracket, there’s only one more line to discuss in
the code so far:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span><span class="boring">

<p>This line prints the string that now contains the user’s input. The <code>{}</code> set of
curly brackets is a placeholder: think of <code>{}</code> as little crab pincers that hold
a value in place. You can print more than one value using curly brackets: the
first set of curly brackets holds the first value listed after the format
string, the second set holds the second value, and so on. Printing multiple
values in one call to <code>println!</code> would look like this:</p>

<p>At this point, the first part of the game is done: we’re getting input from the
keyboard and then printing it.</p>
<h2 id="generating-a-secret-number"><a class="header" href="#generating-a-secret-number">Generating a Secret Number</a></h2>
<p>Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to guess. The
secret number should be different every time so the game is fun to play more
than once. We’ll use a random number between 1 and 100 so the game isn’t too
difficult. Rust doesn’t yet include random number functionality in its standard
library. However, the Rust team does provide a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rand"><code>rand</code> crate</a> with
said functionality.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality"><a class="header" href="#using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality">Using a Crate to Get More Functionality</a></h3>
<p>Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. The project
we’ve been building is a <em>binary crate</em>, which is an executable. The <code>rand</code>
crate is a <em>library crate</em>, which contains code intended to be used in other
programs and can't be executed on its own.</p>
<p>Cargo’s coordination of external crates is where Cargo really shines. Before we
can write code that uses <code>rand</code>, we need to modify the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file to
include the <code>rand</code> crate as a dependency. Open that file now and add the
following line to the bottom beneath the <code>[dependencies]</code> section header that
Cargo created for you. Be sure to specify <code>rand</code> exactly as we have here, with
this version number, or the code examples in this tutorial may not work.</p>
<!-- When updating the version of `rand` used, also update the version of
`rand` used in these files so they all match:
* ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.md
* ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.md
-->
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">rand = &quot;0.8.3&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file, everything that follows a header is part of that
section that continues until another section starts. In <code>[dependencies]</code> you
tell Cargo which external crates your project depends on and which versions of
those crates you require. In this case, we specify the <code>rand</code> crate with the
semantic version specifier <code>0.8.3</code>. Cargo understands <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic
Versioning</a><!-- ignore --> (sometimes called <em>SemVer</em>), which is a
standard for writing version numbers. The number <code>0.8.3</code> is actually shorthand
for <code>^0.8.3</code>, which means any version that is at least <code>0.8.3</code> but below
<code>0.9.0</code>.</p>
<p>Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version
<code>0.8.3</code>, and this specification ensures you’ll get the latest patch release
that will still compile with the code in this chapter. Any version <code>0.9.0</code> or
greater is not guaranteed to have the same API as what the following examples
use.</p>
<p>Now, without changing any of the code, let’s build the project, as shown in
Listing 2-2.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-2: The output from running <code>cargo build</code> after
adding the rand crate as a dependency</span></p>
<p>You may see different version numbers (but they will all be compatible with the
code, thanks to SemVer!), different lines (depending on the operating system),
and the lines may be in a different order.</p>
<p>When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of
everything that dependency needs from the <em>registry</em>, which is a copy of data
from <a href="https://crates.io/">Crates.io</a>. Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem
post their open source Rust projects for others to use.</p>
<p>After updating the registry, Cargo checks the <code>[dependencies]</code> section and
downloads any crates listed that aren’t already downloaded. In this case,
although we only listed <code>rand</code> as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed other crates
that <code>rand</code> depends on to work. After downloading the crates, Rust compiles
them and then compiles the project with the dependencies available.</p>
<p>If you immediately run <code>cargo build</code> again without making any changes, you
won’t get any output aside from the <code>Finished</code> line. Cargo knows it has already
downloaded and compiled the dependencies, and you haven’t changed anything
about them in your <em>Cargo.toml</em> file. Cargo also knows that you haven’t changed
anything about your code, so it doesn’t recompile that either. With nothing to
do, it simply exits.</p>
<p>If you open up the <em>src/main.rs</em> file, make a trivial change, and then save it
and build again, you’ll only see two lines of output:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration

<p>These lines show Cargo only updates the build with your tiny change to the
<em>src/main.rs</em> file. Your dependencies haven’t changed, so Cargo knows it can
reuse what it has already downloaded and compiled for those.</p>
<h4 id="ensuring-reproducible-builds-with-the-cargolock-file"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-reproducible-builds-with-the-cargolock-file">Ensuring Reproducible Builds with the <em>Cargo.lock</em> File</a></h4>
<p>Cargo has a mechanism that ensures you can rebuild the same artifact every time
you or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use only the versions of the
dependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For example, say that
next week version 0.8.4 of the <code>rand</code> crate comes out, and that version
contains an important bug fix, but it also contains a regression that will
break your code. To handle this, Rust creates the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file the first
time you run <code>cargo build</code>, so we now have this in the <em>guessing_game</em>
directory.</p>
<p>When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the
versions of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to
the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will
see that the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file exists and use the versions specified there
rather than doing all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you
have a reproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will
remain at <code>0.8.3</code> until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the <em>Cargo.lock</em>
file. Because the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file is important for reproducible builds, it's
often checked into source control with the rest of the code in your project.</p>
<h4 id="updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version"><a class="header" href="#updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version">Updating a Crate to Get a New Version</a></h4>
<p>When you <em>do</em> want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command <code>update</code>,
which will ignore the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file and figure out all the latest versions
that fit your specifications in <em>Cargo.toml</em>. Cargo will then write those
versions to the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file. Otherwise, by default, Cargo will only look
for versions greater than <code>0.8.3</code> and less than <code>0.9.0</code>. If the <code>rand</code> crate
has released the two new versions <code>0.8.4</code> and <code>0.9.0</code> you would see the
following if you ran <code>cargo update</code>:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration

<p>Cargo ignores the <code>0.9.0</code> release. At this point, you would also notice a
change in your <em>Cargo.lock</em> file noting that the version of the <code>rand</code> crate
you are now using is <code>0.8.4</code>. To use <code>rand</code> version <code>0.9.0</code> or any version in
the <code>0.9.x</code> series, you’d have to update the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file to look like
this instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependencies]
rand = &quot;0.9.0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The next time you run <code>cargo build</code>, Cargo will update the registry of crates
available and reevaluate your <code>rand</code> requirements according to the new version
you have specified.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to say about <a href="http://doc.crates.io">Cargo</a><!-- ignore --> and <a href="http://doc.crates.io/crates-io.html">its
ecosystem</a><!-- ignore --> which we’ll discuss in Chapter 14, but
for now, that’s all you need to know. Cargo makes it very easy to reuse
libraries, so Rustaceans are able to write smaller projects that are assembled
from a number of packages.</p>
<h3 id="generating-a-random-number"><a class="header" href="#generating-a-random-number">Generating a Random Number</a></h3>
<p>Let’s start using <code>rand</code> to generate a number to guess. The next step is to
update <em>src/main.rs</em>, as shown in Listing 2-3.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::io;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    println!(&quot;The secret number is: {secret_number}&quot;);

    println!(&quot;Please input your guess.&quot;);

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)
        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-3: Adding code to generate a random
number</span></p>
<p>First, we add the line <code>use rand::Rng</code>. The <code>Rng</code> trait defines methods that
random number generators implement, and this trait must be in scope for us to
use those methods. Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.</p>
<p>Next, we’re adding two lines in the middle. In the first line, we call the
<code>rand::thread_rng</code> function that gives us the particular random number
generator that we’re going to use: one that is local to the current thread of
execution and seeded by the operating system. Then we call the <code>gen_range</code>
method on the random number generator. This method is defined by the <code>Rng</code>
trait that we brought into scope with the <code>use rand::Rng</code> statement. The
<code>gen_range</code> method takes a range expression as an argument and generates a
random number in the range. The kind of range expression we’re using here takes
the form <code>start..=end</code> and is inclusive on the lower and upper bounds, so we
need to specify <code>1..=100</code> to request a number between 1 and 100.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: You won’t just know which traits to use and which methods and functions
to call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with instructions for
using it. Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the <code>cargo doc --open</code> command will build documentation provided by all of your dependencies
locally and open it in your browser. If you’re interested in other
functionality in the <code>rand</code> crate, for example, run <code>cargo doc --open</code> and
click <code>rand</code> in the sidebar on the left.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second new line prints the secret number. This is useful while we’re
developing the program to be able to test it, but we’ll delete it from the
final version. It’s not much of a game if the program prints the answer as soon
as it starts!</p>
<p>Try running the program a few times:</p>

    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-4: Handling the possible return values of
comparing two numbers</span></p>
<p>First we add another <code>use</code> statement, bringing a type called
<code>std::cmp::Ordering</code> into scope from the standard library. The <code>Ordering</code> type
is another enum and has the variants <code>Less</code>, <code>Greater</code>, and <code>Equal</code>. These are
the three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.</p>
<p>Then we add five new lines at the bottom that use the <code>Ordering</code> type. The
<code>cmp</code> method compares two values and can be called on anything that can be
compared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it’s
comparing the <code>guess</code> to the <code>secret_number</code>. Then it returns a variant of the
<code>Ordering</code> enum we brought into scope with the <code>use</code> statement. We use a
<a href="ch06-02-match.html"><code>match</code></a><!-- ignore --> expression to decide what to do next based on
which variant of <code>Ordering</code> was returned from the call to <code>cmp</code> with the values
in <code>guess</code> and <code>secret_number</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>match</code> expression is made up of <em>arms</em>. An arm consists of a <em>pattern</em> to
match against, and the code that should be run if the value given to <code>match</code>
fits that arm’s pattern. Rust takes the value given to <code>match</code> and looks
through each arm’s pattern in turn. Patterns and the <code>match</code> construct are
powerful Rust features that let you express a variety of situations your code
might encounter and make sure that you handle them all. These features will be
covered in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter 18, respectively.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through an example with the <code>match</code> expression we use here. Say that
the user has guessed 50 and the randomly generated secret number this time is
38. When the code compares 50 to 38, the <code>cmp</code> method will return
<code>Ordering::Greater</code>, because 50 is greater than 38. The <code>match</code> expression gets
the <code>Ordering::Greater</code> value and starts checking each arm’s pattern. It looks
at the first arm’s pattern, <code>Ordering::Less</code>, and sees that the value
<code>Ordering::Greater</code> does not match <code>Ordering::Less</code>, so it ignores the code in
that arm and moves to the next arm. The next arm’s pattern is
<code>Ordering::Greater</code>, which <em>does</em> match <code>Ordering::Greater</code>! The associated
code in that arm will execute and print <code>Too big!</code> to the screen. The <code>match</code>

error: could not compile `guessing_game` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>The core of the error states that there are <em>mismatched types</em>. Rust has a
strong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote
<code>let mut guess = String::new()</code>, Rust was able to infer that <code>guess</code> should be
a <code>String</code> and didn’t make us write the type. The <code>secret_number</code>, on the other
hand, is a number type. A few of Rust’s number types can have a value between 1
and 100: <code>i32</code>, a 32-bit number; <code>u32</code>, an unsigned 32-bit number; <code>i64</code>, a
64-bit number; as well as others. Unless otherwise specified, Rust defaults to
an <code>i32</code>, which is the type of <code>secret_number</code> unless you add type information
elsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different numerical type. The reason
for the error is that Rust cannot compare a string and a number type.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we want to convert the <code>String</code> the program reads as input into a
real number type so we can compare it numerically to the secret number. We do so
by adding this line to the <code>main</code> function body:</p>

<p>The line is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect(&quot;Please type a number!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>We create a variable named <code>guess</code>. But wait, doesn’t the program already have
a variable named <code>guess</code>? It does, but helpfully Rust allows us to <em>shadow</em> the
previous value of <code>guess</code> with a new one. Shadowing lets us reuse the <code>guess</code>
variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as
<code>guess_str</code> and <code>guess</code> for example. We’ll cover this in more detail in Chapter
3, but for now know that this feature is often used when you want to convert a
value from one type to another type.</p>
<p>We bind this new variable to the expression <code>guess.trim().parse()</code>. The <code>guess</code>
in the expression refers to the original <code>guess</code> variable that contained the
input as a string. The <code>trim</code> method on a <code>String</code> instance will eliminate any
whitespace at the beginning and end, which we must do to be able to compare the
string to the <code>u32</code>, which can only contain numerical data. The user must press
<span class="keystroke">enter</span> to satisfy <code>read_line</code> and input their
guess, which adds a newline character to the string. For example, if the user
types <span class="keystroke">5</span> and presses <span
class="keystroke">enter</span>, <code>guess</code> looks like this: <code>5\n</code>. The <code>\n</code>
represents “newline”. (On Windows, pressing <span
class="keystroke">enter</span> results in a carriage return and a newline,
<code>\r\n</code>). The <code>trim</code> method eliminates <code>\n</code> or <code>\r\n</code>, resulting in just <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../std/primitive.str.html#method.parse"><code>parse</code> method on strings</a><!-- ignore --> converts a string to
another type. Here, we use it to convert from a string to a number. We need to
tell Rust the exact number type we want by using <code>let guess: u32</code>. The colon
(<code>:</code>) after <code>guess</code> tells Rust we’ll annotate the variable’s type. Rust has a
few built-in number types; the <code>u32</code> seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer.
It’s a good default choice for a small positive number. You’ll learn about
other number types in Chapter 3. Additionally, the <code>u32</code> annotation in this
example program and the comparison with <code>secret_number</code> means that Rust will
infer that <code>secret_number</code> should be a <code>u32</code> as well. So now the comparison
will be between two values of the same type!</p>
<p>The <code>parse</code> method will only work on characters that can logically be converted
into numbers and so can easily cause errors. If, for example, the string
contained <code>A👍%</code>, there would be no way to convert that to a number. Because it
might fail, the <code>parse</code> method returns a <code>Result</code> type, much as the <code>read_line</code>
method does (discussed earlier in <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#handling-potential-failure-with-the-result-type">“Handling Potential Failure with the
<code>Result</code> Type”</a><!-- ignore
-->). We’ll treat this <code>Result</code> the same way by using the <code>expect</code> method
again. If <code>parse</code> returns an <code>Err</code> <code>Result</code> variant because it couldn’t create
a number from the string, the <code>expect</code> call will crash the game and print the
message we give it. If <code>parse</code> can successfully convert the string to a number,
it will return the <code>Ok</code> variant of <code>Result</code>, and <code>expect</code> will return the
number that we want from the <code>Ok</code> value.</p>
<p>Let’s run the program now!</p>

<p>Nice! Even though spaces were added before the guess, the program still figured

<p>We have most of the game working now, but the user can make only one guess.
Let’s change that by adding a loop!</p>
<h2 id="allowing-multiple-guesses-with-looping"><a class="header" href="#allowing-multiple-guesses-with-looping">Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping</a></h2>

<p>As you can see, we’ve moved everything from the guess input prompt onward into

<p>The user could always interrupt the program by using the keyboard shortcut
<span class="keystroke">ctrl-c</span>. But there’s another way to escape this

<p><span class="caption">Listing 2-5: Ignoring a non-number guess and asking for
another guess instead of crashing the program</span></p>
<p>We switch from an <code>expect</code> call to a <code>match</code> expression to move from crashing
on an error to handling the error. Remember that <code>parse</code> returns a <code>Result</code>
type and <code>Result</code> is an enum that has the variants <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. We’re using
a <code>match</code> expression here, as we did with the <code>Ordering</code> result of the <code>cmp</code>
method.</p>
<p>If <code>parse</code> is able to successfully turn the string into a number, it will
return an <code>Ok</code> value that contains the resulting number. That <code>Ok</code> value will
match the first arm’s pattern, and the <code>match</code> expression will just return the
<code>num</code> value that <code>parse</code> produced and put inside the <code>Ok</code> value. That number
will end up right where we want it in the new <code>guess</code> variable we’re creating.</p>
<p>If <code>parse</code> is <em>not</em> able to turn the string into a number, it will return an
<code>Err</code> value that contains more information about the error. The <code>Err</code> value
does not match the <code>Ok(num)</code> pattern in the first <code>match</code> arm, but it does
match the <code>Err(_)</code> pattern in the second arm. The underscore, <code>_</code>, is a
catchall value; in this example, we’re saying we want to match all <code>Err</code>
values, no matter what information they have inside them. So the program will
execute the second arm’s code, <code>continue</code>, which tells the program to go to the
next iteration of the <code>loop</code> and ask for another guess. So, effectively, the
program ignores all errors that <code>parse</code> might encounter!</p>
<p>Now everything in the program should work as expected. Let’s try it:</p>

<h2 id="summary-1"><a class="header" href="#summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>At this point, you’ve successfully built the guessing game. Congratulations!</p>
<p>This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts:
<code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, functions, the use of external crates, and more. In the next
few chapters, you’ll learn about these concepts in more detail. Chapter 3
covers concepts that most programming languages have, such as variables, data
types, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust. Chapter 4 explores
ownership, a feature that makes Rust different from other languages. Chapter 5
discusses structs and method syntax, and Chapter 6 explains how enums work.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="common-programming-concepts"><a class="header" href="#common-programming-concepts">Common Programming Concepts</a></h1>
<p>This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language
and how they work in Rust. Many programming languages have much in common at
their core. None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust,
but we’ll discuss them in the context of Rust and explain the conventions
around using these concepts.</p>
<p>Specifically, you’ll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments,
and control flow. These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning
them early will give you a strong core to start from.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="keywords"><a class="header" href="#keywords">Keywords</a></h4>
<p>The Rust language has a set of <em>keywords</em> that are reserved for use by
the language only, much as in other languages. Keep in mind that you cannot
use these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have
special meanings, and you’ll be using them to do various tasks in your Rust
programs; a few have no current functionality associated with them but have
been reserved for functionality that might be added to Rust in the future. You
can find a list of the keywords in <a href="appendix-01-keywords.html">Appendix A</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="variables-and-mutability"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-mutability">Variables and Mutability</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#storing-values-with-variables">“Storing Values with
Variables”</a><!-- ignore --> section, by default
variables are immutable. This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write
your code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that
Rust offers. However, you still have the option to make your variables mutable.
Let’s explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor immutability and why
sometimes you might want to opt out.</p>
<p>When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t change
that value. To illustrate this, let’s generate a new project called <em>variables</em>
in your <em>projects</em> directory by using <code>cargo new variables</code>.</p>
<p>Then, in your new <em>variables</em> directory, open <em>src/main.rs</em> and replace its
code with the following code. This code won’t compile just yet, we’ll first
examine the immutability error.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
    x = 6;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Save and run the program using <code>cargo run</code>. You should receive an error
message, as shown in this output:</p>

isn’t safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do <em>not</em> mean that you’re
not a good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors.</p>
<p>The error message indicates that the cause of the error is that you <code>cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`</code>, because you tried to assign a second
value to the immutable <code>x</code> variable.</p>
<p>It’s important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a
value that’s designated as immutable because this very situation can lead to
bugs. If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a value will
never change and another part of our code changes that value, it’s possible
that the first part of the code won’t do what it was designed to do. The cause
of this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially
when the second piece of code changes the value only <em>sometimes</em>. The Rust
compiler guarantees that when you state a value won’t change, it really won’t
change, so you don’t have to keep track of it yourself. Your code is thus
easier to reason through.</p>
<p>But mutability can be very useful, and can make code more convenient to write. 
Although variables are immutable by default, you can make them mutable by adding 
<code>mut</code> in front of the variable name as you did in Chapter 2. Adding <code>mut</code> also
conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of
the code will be changing this variable’s value.</p>
<p>For example, let’s change <em>src/main.rs</em> to the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
    x = 6;
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>When we run the program now, we get this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 5
The value of x is: 6
</code></pre>
<p>We’re allowed to change the value bound to <code>x</code> from <code>5</code> to <code>6</code> when <code>mut</code>
is used. Ultimately, deciding whether to use mutability or not is up to you and
depends on what you think is clearest in that particular situation.</p>

<h3 id="constants"><a class="header" href="#constants">Constants</a></h3>
<p>Like immutable variables, <em>constants</em> are values that are bound to a name and
are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants
and variables.</p>
<p>First, you aren’t allowed to use <code>mut</code> with constants. Constants aren’t just
immutable by default—they’re always immutable. You declare constants using the
<code>const</code> keyword instead of the <code>let</code> keyword, and the type of the value <em>must</em>
be annotated. We’re about to cover types and type annotations in the next
section, <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types">“Data Types,”</a><!-- ignore --> so don’t worry about the
details right now. Just know that you must always annotate the type.</p>
<p>Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes
them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.</p>
<p>The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression,
not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a constant declaration:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The constant’s name is <code>THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS</code> and its value is set to the
result of multiplying 60 (the number of seconds in a minute) by 60 (the number
of minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to count in this
program). Rust’s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with
underscores between words. The compiler is able to evaluate a limited set of
operations at compile time, which lets us choose to write out this value in a
way that’s easier to understand and verify, rather than setting this constant
to the value 10,800. See the <a href="../reference/const_eval.html">Rust Reference’s section on constant
evaluation</a> for more information on what operations can be used
when declaring constants.</p>
<p>Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope they
were declared in. This property makes constants useful for values in your
application domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know about,
such as the maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to earn or
the speed of light.</p>
<p>Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in
conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code. It also
helps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the
hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.</p>
<div class="quiz-placeholder" data-quiz-name="ch03-01-variables-and-mutability-sec2-constants"  data-quiz-questions="{&quot;questions&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;MultipleChoice&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;answer&quot;:1},&quot;prompt&quot;:{&quot;choices&quot;:[&quot;They are just different syntaxes for declaring variables with the same semantics&quot;,&quot;`const` can be used in the global scope, and `let` can only be used in a function&quot;,&quot;The compiler will error if a `const` variable's name is not using `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`&quot;,&quot;A `const` can only be assigned to an atomic constant, not a expression involving computation&quot;],&quot;prompt&quot;:&quot;What is the difference between using `let` and `const` to declare a variable?&quot;}},{&quot;context&quot;:&quot;`const` variables are allowed to be defined outside of a function and to do limited forms of computation.\n&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Tracing&quot;,&quot;answer&quot;:{&quot;doesCompile&quot;:true,&quot;stdout&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;prompt&quot;:{&quot;program&quot;:&quot;const TWO: u32 = 1 + 1;\nfn main() {\n  println!(\&quot;{TWO}\&quot;);\n}\n&quot;}}]}"  data-quiz-fullscreen=""  data-quiz-cache-answers="" ></div>
<h3 id="shadowing"><a class="header" href="#shadowing">Shadowing</a></h3>
<p>As you saw in the guessing game tutorial in <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number">Chapter
2</a><!-- ignore -->, you can declare a
new variable with the same name as a previous variable. Rustaceans say that the
first variable is <em>shadowed</em> by the second, which means that the second
variable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable.
In effect, the second variable overshadows the first, taking any uses of the
variable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends.
We can shadow a variable by using the same variable’s name and repeating the
use of the <code>let</code> keyword as follows:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!(&quot;The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}&quot;);
    }

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program first binds <code>x</code> to a value of <code>5</code>. Then it creates a new variable
<code>x</code> by repeating <code>let x =</code>, taking the original value and adding <code>1</code> so the
value of <code>x</code> is then <code>6</code>. Then, within an inner scope created with the curly
brackets, the third <code>let</code> statement also shadows <code>x</code> and creates a new
variable, multiplying the previous value by <code>2</code> to give <code>x</code> a value of <code>12</code>.
When that scope is over, the inner shadowing ends and <code>x</code> returns to being <code>6</code>.
When we run this program, it will output the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
</code></pre>
<p>Shadowing is different from marking a variable as <code>mut</code>, because we’ll get a
compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without
using the <code>let</code> keyword. By using <code>let</code>, we can perform a few transformations
on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have
been completed.</p>
<p>The other difference between <code>mut</code> and shadowing is that because we’re
effectively creating a new variable when we use the <code>let</code> keyword again, we can
change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our
program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by
inputting space characters, and then we want to store that input as a number:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let spaces = &quot;   &quot;;
    let spaces = spaces.len();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The first <code>spaces</code> variable is a string type and the second <code>spaces</code> variable
is a number type. Shadowing thus spares us from having to come up with
different names, such as <code>spaces_str</code> and <code>spaces_num</code>; instead, we can reuse
the simpler <code>spaces</code> name. However, if we try to use <code>mut</code> for this, as shown
here, we’ll get a compile-time error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut spaces = &quot;   &quot;;
    spaces = spaces.len();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The error says we’re not allowed to mutate a variable’s type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)

<p>Every value in Rust is of a certain <em>data type</em>, which tells Rust what kind of
data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. We’ll look at
two data type subsets: scalar and compound.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Rust is a <em>statically typed</em> language, which means that it
must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually
infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases
when many types are possible, such as when we converted a <code>String</code> to a numeric
type using <code>parse</code> in the <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number">“Comparing the Guess to the Secret

<p>If we don’t add the <code>: u32</code> type annotation above, Rust will display the

</code></pre>
<p>You’ll see different type annotations for other data types.</p>
<h3 id="scalar-types"><a class="header" href="#scalar-types">Scalar Types</a></h3>
<p>A <em>scalar</em> type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:
integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. You may recognize
these from other programming languages. Let’s jump into how they work in Rust.</p>
<h4 id="integer-types"><a class="header" href="#integer-types">Integer Types</a></h4>
<p>An <em>integer</em> is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer
type in Chapter 2, the <code>u32</code> type. This type declaration indicates that the
value it’s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types
start with <code>i</code>, instead of <code>u</code>) that takes up 32 bits of space. Table 3-1 shows
the built-in integer types in Rust. We can use any of these variants to declare
the type of an integer value.</p>
<p><span class="caption">Table 3-1: Integer Types in Rust</span></p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Length</th><th>Signed</th><th>Unsigned</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>8-bit</td><td><code>i8</code></td><td><code>u8</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>16-bit</td><td><code>i16</code></td><td><code>u16</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>32-bit</td><td><code>i32</code></td><td><code>u32</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>64-bit</td><td><code>i64</code></td><td><code>u64</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>128-bit</td><td><code>i128</code></td><td><code>u128</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>arch</td><td><code>isize</code></td><td><code>usize</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.
<em>Signed</em> and <em>unsigned</em> refer to whether it’s possible for the number to be
negative—in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it
(signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be
represented without a sign (unsigned). It’s like writing numbers on paper: when
the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however,
when it’s safe to assume the number is positive, it’s shown with no sign.
Signed numbers are stored using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two’s
complement</a><!-- ignore -->
representation.</p>
<p>Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n - 1</sup>) to 2<sup>n -
1</sup> - 1 inclusive, where <em>n</em> is the number of bits that variant uses. So an
<code>i8</code> can store numbers from -(2<sup>7</sup>) to 2<sup>7</sup> - 1, which equals
-128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1,
so a <code>u8</code> can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>8</sup> - 1, which equals 0 to 255.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>isize</code> and <code>usize</code> types depend on the architecture of the
computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as “arch”:
64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit
architecture.</p>
<p>You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3-2. Note
that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix,
such as <code>57u8</code>, to designate the type. Number literals can also use <code>_</code> as a
visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as <code>1_000</code>, which will
have the same value as if you had specified <code>1000</code>.</p>
<p><span class="caption">Table 3-2: Integer Literals in Rust</span></p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Number literals</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Decimal</td><td><code>98_222</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Hex</td><td><code>0xff</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Octal</td><td><code>0o77</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Binary</td><td><code>0b1111_0000</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>Byte (<code>u8</code> only)</td><td><code>b'A'</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you’re unsure, Rust’s
defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to <code>i32</code>.
The primary situation in which you’d use <code>isize</code> or <code>usize</code> is when indexing
some sort of collection.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="integer-overflow"><a class="header" href="#integer-overflow">Integer Overflow</a></h5>
<p>Let’s say you have a variable of type <code>u8</code> that can hold values between 0 and
255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside of that range, such
as 256, <em>integer overflow</em> will occur, which can result in one of two
behaviors. When you’re compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for
integer overflow that cause your program to <em>panic</em> at runtime if this
behavior occurs. Rust uses the term panicking when a program exits with an
error; we’ll discuss panics in more depth in the <a href="ch09-01-unrecoverable-errors-with-panic.html">“Unrecoverable Errors with
<code>panic!</code>”</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter
9.</p>
<p>When you’re compiling in release mode with the <code>--release</code> flag, Rust does
<em>not</em> include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if
overflow occurs, Rust performs <em>two’s complement wrapping</em>. In short, values
greater than the maximum value the type can hold “wrap around” to the minimum
of the values the type can hold. In the case of a <code>u8</code>, the value 256 becomes
0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on. The program won’t panic, but the
variable will have a value that probably isn’t what you were expecting it to
have. Relying on integer overflow’s wrapping behavior is considered an error.</p>
<p>To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families
of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrap in all modes with the <code>wrapping_*</code> methods, such as <code>wrapping_add</code></li>
<li>Return the <code>None</code> value if there is overflow with the <code>checked_*</code> methods</li>
<li>Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with
the <code>overflowing_*</code> methods</li>
<li>Saturate at the value’s minimum or maximum values with <code>saturating_*</code>
methods</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="floating-point-types"><a class="header" href="#floating-point-types">Floating-Point Types</a></h4>
<p>Rust also has two primitive types for <em>floating-point numbers</em>, which are
numbers with decimal points. Rust’s floating-point types are <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code>,
which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is <code>f64</code>
because on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as <code>f32</code> but is capable of
more precision. All floating-point types are signed.</p>
<p>Here’s an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The
<code>f32</code> type is a single-precision float, and <code>f64</code> has double precision.</p>
<h4 id="numeric-operations"><a class="header" href="#numeric-operations">Numeric Operations</a></h4>
<p>Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you’d expect for all of the
number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.
Integer division rounds down to the nearest integer. The following code shows
how you’d use each numeric operation in a <code>let</code> statement:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let floored = 2 / 3; // Results in 0

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates
to a single value, which is then bound to a variable. <a href="appendix-02-operators.html">Appendix B</a><!-- ignore --> contains a
list of all operators that Rust provides.</p>
<h4 id="the-boolean-type"><a class="header" href="#the-boolean-type">The Boolean Type</a></h4>
<p>As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible
values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in
Rust is specified using <code>bool</code>. For example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an <code>if</code>
expression. We’ll cover how <code>if</code> expressions work in Rust in the <a href="ch03-05-control-flow.html#control-flow">“Control
Flow”</a><!-- ignore --> section.</p>
<h4 id="the-character-type"><a class="header" href="#the-character-type">The Character Type</a></h4>
<p>Rust’s <code>char</code> type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type. Here’s
some examples of declaring <code>char</code> values:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'ℤ'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that we specify <code>char</code> literals with single quotes, as opposed to string
literals, which use double quotes. Rust’s <code>char</code> type is four bytes in size and
represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than
just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji;
and zero-width spaces are all valid <code>char</code> values in Rust. Unicode Scalar
Values range from <code>U+0000</code> to <code>U+D7FF</code> and <code>U+E000</code> to <code>U+10FFFF</code> inclusive.
However, a “character” isn’t really a concept in Unicode, so your human
intuition for what a “character” is may not match up with what a <code>char</code> is in

<h3 id="compound-types"><a class="header" href="#compound-types">Compound Types</a></h3>
<p><em>Compound types</em> can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two
primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.</p>
<h4 id="the-tuple-type"><a class="header" href="#the-tuple-type">The Tuple Type</a></h4>
<p>A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety
of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared,
they cannot grow or shrink in size.</p>
<p>We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside
parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the
different values in the tuple don’t have to be the same. We’ve added optional
type annotations in this example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The variable <code>tup</code> binds to the entire tuple, because a tuple is considered a
single compound element. To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can
use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!(&quot;The value of y is: {y}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable <code>tup</code>. It then
uses a pattern with <code>let</code> to take <code>tup</code> and turn it into three separate
variables, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. This is called <em>destructuring</em>, because it breaks
the single tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of
<code>y</code>, which is <code>6.4</code>.</p>
<p>We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (<code>.</code>) followed by
the index of the value we want to access. For example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program creates the tuple <code>x</code> and then accesses each element of the tuple
using their respective indices. As with most programming languages, the first
index in a tuple is 0.</p>
<p>The tuple without any values has a special name, <em>unit</em>. This value and its
corresponding type are both written <code>()</code> and represent an empty value or an
empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don’t
return any other value.</p>
<h4 id="the-array-type"><a class="header" href="#the-array-type">The Array Type</a></h4>
<p>Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an <em>array</em>. Unlike
a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in
some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.</p>
<p>We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square
brackets:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than
the heap (we will discuss the stack and the heap more in <a href="ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#the-stack-and-the-heap">Chapter
4</a><!-- ignore -->) or when you want to ensure you always have a
fixed number of elements. An array isn’t as flexible as the vector type,
though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library
that <em>is</em> allowed to grow or shrink in size. If you’re unsure whether to use an
array or a vector, chances are you should use a vector. <a href="ch08-01-vectors.html">Chapter
8</a><!-- ignore --> discusses vectors in more detail.</p>
<p>However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not
need to change. For example, if you were using the names of the month in a
program, you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know
it will always contain 12 elements:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let months = [&quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;,
              &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot;];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>You write an array’s type using square brackets with the type of each element,
a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, <code>i32</code> is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number <code>5</code>
indicates the array contains five elements.</p>
<p>You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by
specifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of
the array in square brackets, as shown here:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let a = [3; 5];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The array named <code>a</code> will contain <code>5</code> elements that will all be set to the value
<code>3</code> initially. This is the same as writing <code>let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];</code> but in a
more concise way.</p>
<h5 id="accessing-array-elements"><a class="header" href="#accessing-array-elements">Accessing Array Elements</a></h5>
<p>An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be
allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing,
like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, the variable named <code>first</code> will get the value <code>1</code>, because
that is the value at index <code>[0]</code> in the array. The variable named <code>second</code> will
get the value <code>2</code> from index <code>[1]</code> in the array.</p>
<h5 id="invalid-array-element-access"><a class="header" href="#invalid-array-element-access">Invalid Array Element Access</a></h5>
<p>Let’s see what happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past
the end of the array. Say you run this code, similar to the guessing game in
Chapter 2, to get an array index from the user:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore panics">use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!(&quot;Please enter an array index.&quot;);

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&amp;mut index)
        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect(&quot;Index entered was not a number&quot;);

    let element = a[index];

    println!(&quot;The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code compiles successfully. If you run this code using <code>cargo run</code> and
enter 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, the program will print out the corresponding value at
that index in the array. If you instead enter a number past the end of the
array, such as 10, you’ll see output like this:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-15-invalid-array-access
cargo run
10
-->
<pre><code class="language-console">thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src/main.rs:19:19
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
</code></pre>
<p>The program resulted in a <em>runtime</em> error at the point of using an invalid
value in the indexing operation. The program exited with an error message and
didn’t execute the final <code>println!</code> statement. When you attempt to access an
element using indexing, Rust will check that the index you’ve specified is less
than the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the length,
Rust will panic. This check has to happen at runtime, especially in this case,
because the compiler can’t possibly know what value a user will enter when they
run the code later.</p>
<p>This is an example of Rust’s memory safety principles in action. In many
low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an
incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this
kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and
continuing. Chapter 9 discusses more of Rust’s error handling and how you can
write readable, safe code that neither panics nor allows invalid memory access.</p>

<p>Functions are prevalent in Rust code. You’ve already seen one of the most
important functions in the language: the <code>main</code> function, which is the entry
point of many programs. You’ve also seen the <code>fn</code> keyword, which allows you to
declare new functions.</p>
<p>Rust code uses <em>snake case</em> as the conventional style for function and variable
names, in which all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.
Here’s a program that contains an example function definition:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!(&quot;Another function.&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>We define a function in Rust by entering <code>fn</code> followed by a function name and a
set of parentheses. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function
body begins and ends.</p>
<p>We can call any function we’ve defined by entering its name followed by a set
of parentheses. Because <code>another_function</code> is defined in the program, it can be
called from inside the <code>main</code> function. Note that we defined <code>another_function</code>
<em>after</em> the <code>main</code> function in the source code; we could have defined it before
as well. Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re
defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.</p>
<p>Let’s start a new binary project named <em>functions</em> to explore functions
further. Place the <code>another_function</code> example in <em>src/main.rs</em> and run it. You
should see the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.28s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
Hello, world!
Another function.
</code></pre>
<p>The lines execute in the order in which they appear in the <code>main</code> function.
First, the “Hello, world!” message prints, and then <code>another_function</code> is
called and its message is printed.</p>
<h3 id="parameters"><a class="header" href="#parameters">Parameters</a></h3>
<p>We can define functions to have <em>parameters</em>, which are special variables that
are part of a function’s signature. When a function has parameters, you can
provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete
values are called <em>arguments</em>, but in casual conversation, people tend to use
the words <em>parameter</em> and <em>argument</em> interchangeably for either the variables
in a function’s definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a
function.</p>
<p>In this version of <code>another_function</code> we add a parameter:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Try running this program; you should get the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.21s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5
</code></pre>
<p>The declaration of <code>another_function</code> has one parameter named <code>x</code>. The type of
<code>x</code> is specified as <code>i32</code>. When we pass <code>5</code> in to <code>another_function</code>, the
<code>println!</code> macro puts <code>5</code> where the pair of curly brackets containing <code>x</code> was
in the format string.</p>
<p>In function signatures, you <em>must</em> declare the type of each parameter. This is
a deliberate decision in Rust’s design: requiring type annotations in function
definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in
the code to figure out what type you mean. The compiler is also able to give
more helpful error messages if it knows what types the function expects.</p>
<p>When defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with
commas, like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!(&quot;The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This example creates a function named <code>print_labeled_measurement</code> with two
parameters. The first parameter is named <code>value</code> and is an <code>i32</code>. The second is
named <code>unit_label</code> and is type <code>char</code>. The function then prints text containing
both the <code>value</code> and the <code>unit_label</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s try running this code. Replace the program currently in your <em>functions</em>
project’s <em>src/main.rs</em> file with the preceding example and run it using <code>cargo run</code>:</p>

The measurement is: 5h
</code></pre>
<p>Because we called the function with <code>5</code> as the value for <code>value</code> and <code>'h'</code> as
the value for <code>unit_label</code>, the program output contains those values.</p>

<h3 id="statements-and-expressions"><a class="header" href="#statements-and-expressions">Statements and Expressions</a></h3>
<p>Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an
expression. So far, the functions we’ve covered haven’t included an ending
expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because
Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to
understand. Other languages don’t have the same distinctions, so let’s look at
what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies
of functions.</p>
<p><em>Statements</em> are instructions that perform some action and do not return a
value. <em>Expressions</em> evaluate to a resulting value. Let’s look at some examples.</p>
<p>We’ve actually already used statements and expressions. Creating a variable and
assigning a value to it with the <code>let</code> keyword is a statement. In Listing 3-1,
<code>let y = 6;</code> is a statement.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let y = 6;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 3-1: A <code>main</code> function declaration containing one statement</span></p>
<p>Function definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a
statement in itself.</p>
<p>Statements do not return values. Therefore, you can’t assign a <code>let</code> statement
to another variable, as the following code tries to do; you’ll get an error:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you run this program, the error you’ll get looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>let y = 6</code> statement does not return a value, so there isn’t anything for
<code>x</code> to bind to. This is different from what happens in other languages, such as
C and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In those
languages, you can write <code>x = y = 6</code> and have both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have the value
<code>6</code>; that is not the case in Rust.</p>
<p>Expressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that
you’ll write in Rust. Consider a math operation, such as <code>5 + 6</code>, which is an
expression that evaluates to the value <code>11</code>. Expressions can be part of
statements: in Listing 3-1, the <code>6</code> in the statement <code>let y = 6;</code> is an
expression that evaluates to the value <code>6</code>. Calling a function is an
expression. Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with
curly brackets is an expression, for example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!(&quot;The value of y is: {y}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
</code></pre>
<p>is a block that, in this case, evaluates to <code>4</code>. That value gets bound to <code>y</code>
as part of the <code>let</code> statement. Note that the <code>x + 1</code> line doesn’t have a
semicolon at the end, unlike most of the lines you’ve seen so far. Expressions
do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an
expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value.
Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions next.</p>
<h3 id="functions-with-return-values"><a class="header" href="#functions-with-return-values">Functions with Return Values</a></h3>
<p>Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don’t name return
values, but we must declare their type after an arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>). In Rust, the
return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final
expression in the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a
function by using the <code>return</code> keyword and specifying a value, but most
functions return the last expression implicitly. Here’s an example of a
function that returns a value:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn five() -&gt; i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!(&quot;The value of x is: {x}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>There are no function calls, macros, or even <code>let</code> statements in the <code>five</code>
function—just the number <code>5</code> by itself. That’s a perfectly valid function in
Rust. Note that the function’s return type is specified too, as <code>-&gt; i32</code>. Try
running this code; the output should look like this:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>5</code> in <code>five</code> is the function’s return value, which is why the return type
is <code>i32</code>. Let’s examine this in more detail. There are two important bits:
first, the line <code>let x = five();</code> shows that we’re using the return value of a
function to initialize a variable. Because the function <code>five</code> returns a <code>5</code>,
that line is the same as the following:</p>

<p>Second, the <code>five</code> function has no parameters and defines the type of the

<p>The main error message, “mismatched types,” reveals the core issue with this
code. The definition of the function <code>plus_one</code> says that it will return an
<code>i32</code>, but statements don’t evaluate to a value, which is expressed by <code>()</code>,
the unit type. Therefore, nothing is returned, which contradicts the function
definition and results in an error. In this output, Rust provides a message to
possibly help rectify this issue: it suggests removing the semicolon, which
would fix the error.</p>

<p>All programmers strive to make their code easy to understand, but sometimes
extra explanation is warranted. In these cases, programmers leave <em>comments</em> in
their source code that the compiler will ignore but people reading the source
code may find useful.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple comment:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// hello, world
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In Rust, the idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes, and the
comment continues until the end of the line. For comments that extend beyond a
single line, you’ll need to include <code>//</code> on each line, like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// So we’re doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what’s going on.
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7; // I’m feeling lucky today
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>But you’ll more often see them used in this format, with the comment on a
separate line above the code it’s annotating:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    // I’m feeling lucky today
    let lucky_number = 7;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Rust also has another kind of comment, documentation comments, which we’ll
discuss in the “Publishing a Crate to Crates.io” section of Chapter 14.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="control-flow"><a class="header" href="#control-flow">Control Flow</a></h2>
<p>The ability to run some code depending on if a condition is true, or run some
code repeatedly while a condition is true, are basic building blocks in most
programming languages. The most common constructs that let you control the flow
of execution of Rust code are <code>if</code> expressions and loops.</p>
<h3 id="if-expressions"><a class="header" href="#if-expressions"><code>if</code> Expressions</a></h3>
<p>An <code>if</code> expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions. You
provide a condition and then state, “If this condition is met, run this block
of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.”</p>
<p>Create a new project called <em>branches</em> in your <em>projects</em> directory to explore
the <code>if</code> expression. In the <em>src/main.rs</em> file, input the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number &lt; 5 {
        println!(&quot;condition was true&quot;);
    } else {
        println!(&quot;condition was false&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>All <code>if</code> expressions start with the keyword <code>if</code>, followed by a condition. In
this case, the condition checks whether or not the variable <code>number</code> has a
value less than 5. We place the block of code to execute if the condition is true
immediately after the condition inside curly brackets. Blocks of code
associated with the conditions in <code>if</code> expressions are sometimes called <em>arms</em>,
just like the arms in <code>match</code> expressions that we discussed in the <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#comparing-the-guess-to-the-secret-number">“Comparing
the Guess to the Secret Number”</a><!--
ignore --> section of Chapter 2.</p>
<p>Optionally, we can also include an <code>else</code> expression, which we chose
to do here, to give the program an alternative block of code to execute should
the condition evaluate to false. If you don’t provide an <code>else</code> expression and
the condition is false, the program will just skip the <code>if</code> block and move on
to the next bit of code.</p>
<p>Try running this code; you should see the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was true
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s try changing the value of <code>number</code> to a value that makes the condition
<code>false</code> to see what happens:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let number = 7;
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    if number &lt; 5 {
</span><span class="boring">        println!(&quot;condition was true&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    } else {
</span><span class="boring">        println!(&quot;condition was false&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    }
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Run the program again, and look at the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was false
</code></pre>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the condition in this code <em>must</em> be a <code>bool</code>. If
the condition isn’t a <code>bool</code>, we’ll get an error. For example, try running the
following code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number {
        println!(&quot;number was three&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>if</code> condition evaluates to a value of <code>3</code> this time, and Rust throws an
error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<p>The error indicates that Rust expected a <code>bool</code> but got an integer. Unlike
languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust will not automatically try to
convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean. You must be explicit and always provide
<code>if</code> with a Boolean as its condition. If we want the <code>if</code> code block to run
only when a number is not equal to <code>0</code>, for example, we can change the <code>if</code>
expression to the following:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number != 0 {
        println!(&quot;number was something other than zero&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Running this code will print <code>number was something other than zero</code>.</p>
<h4 id="handling-multiple-conditions-with-else-if"><a class="header" href="#handling-multiple-conditions-with-else-if">Handling Multiple Conditions with <code>else if</code></a></h4>
<p>You can use multiple conditions by combining <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> in an <code>else if</code>
expression. For example:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!(&quot;number is divisible by 4&quot;);
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!(&quot;number is divisible by 3&quot;);
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!(&quot;number is divisible by 2&quot;);
    } else {
        println!(&quot;number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This program has four possible paths it can take. After running it, you should
see the following output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

number is divisible by 3
</code></pre>
<p>When this program executes, it checks each <code>if</code> expression in turn and executes
the first body for which the condition holds true. Note that even though 6 is
divisible by 2, we don’t see the output <code>number is divisible by 2</code>, nor do we
see the <code>number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2</code> text from the <code>else</code> block.
That’s because Rust only executes the block for the first true condition, and
once it finds one, it doesn’t even check the rest.</p>
<p>Using too many <code>else if</code> expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more
than one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful
Rust branching construct called <code>match</code> for these cases.</p>
<h4 id="using-if-in-a-let-statement"><a class="header" href="#using-if-in-a-let-statement">Using <code>if</code> in a <code>let</code> Statement</a></h4>
<p>Because <code>if</code> is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a <code>let</code>
statement to assign the outcome to a variable, as in Listing 3-2.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let condition = true;

<p>Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and
numbers by themselves are also expressions. In this case, the value of the
whole <code>if</code> expression depends on which block of code executes. This means the
values that have the potential to be results from each arm of the <code>if</code> must be
the same type; in Listing 3-2, the results of both the <code>if</code> arm and the <code>else</code>
arm were <code>i32</code> integers. If the types are mismatched, as in the following

</code></pre>
<p>The expression in the <code>if</code> block evaluates to an integer, and the expression in
the <code>else</code> block evaluates to a string. This won’t work because variables must
have a single type, and Rust needs to know at compile time what type the
<code>number</code> variable is, definitively. Knowing the type of <code>number</code> lets the
compiler verify the type is valid everywhere we use <code>number</code>. Rust wouldn’t be
able to do that if the type of <code>number</code> was only determined at runtime; the
compiler would be more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code
if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.</p>

<h3 id="repetition-with-loops"><a class="header" href="#repetition-with-loops">Repetition with Loops</a></h3>
<p>It’s often useful to execute a block of code more than once. For this task,
Rust provides several <em>loops</em>, which will run through the code inside the loop
body to the end and then start immediately back at the beginning. To
experiment with loops, let’s make a new project called <em>loops</em>.</p>
<p>Rust has three kinds of loops: <code>loop</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code>. Let’s try each one.</p>
<h4 id="repeating-code-with-loop"><a class="header" href="#repeating-code-with-loop">Repeating Code with <code>loop</code></a></h4>
<p>The <code>loop</code> keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again
forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.</p>
<p>As an example, change the <em>src/main.rs</em> file in your <em>loops</em> directory to look
like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    loop {
        println!(&quot;again!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we run this program, we’ll see <code>again!</code> printed over and over continuously
until we stop the program manually. Most terminals support the keyboard shortcut
<span class="keystroke">ctrl-c</span> to interrupt a program that is stuck in
a continual loop. Give it a try:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch03-common-programming-concepts/no-listing-32-loop

     Running `target/debug/loops`
again!
again!
again!
again!
^Cagain!
</code></pre>
<p>The symbol <code>^C</code> represents where you pressed <span class="keystroke">ctrl-c
</span>. You may or may not see the word <code>again!</code> printed after the <code>^C</code>,
depending on where the code was in the loop when it received the interrupt
signal.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Rust also provides a way to break out of a loop using code. You
can place the <code>break</code> keyword within the loop to tell the program when to stop
executing the loop. Recall that we did this in the guessing game in the
<a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#quitting-after-a-correct-guess">“Quitting After a Correct Guess”</a><!-- ignore
--> section of Chapter 2 to exit the program when the user won the game by
guessing the correct number.</p>
<p>We also used <code>continue</code> in the guessing game, which in a loop tells the program
to skip over any remaining code in this iteration of the loop and go to the
next iteration.</p>
<h4 id="returning-values-from-loops"><a class="header" href="#returning-values-from-loops">Returning Values from Loops</a></h4>
<p>One of the uses of a <code>loop</code> is to retry an operation you know might fail, such
as checking whether a thread has completed its job. You might also need to pass
the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To do
this, you can add the value you want returned after the <code>break</code> expression you
use to stop the loop; that value will be returned out of the loop so you can
use it, as shown here:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!(&quot;The result is {result}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Before the loop, we declare a variable named <code>counter</code> and initialize it to
<code>0</code>. Then we declare a variable named <code>result</code> to hold the value returned from
the loop. On every iteration of the loop, we add <code>1</code> to the <code>counter</code> variable,
and then check whether the counter is equal to <code>10</code>. When it is, we use the
<code>break</code> keyword with the value <code>counter * 2</code>. After the loop, we use a
semicolon to end the statement that assigns the value to <code>result</code>. Finally, we
print the value in <code>result</code>, which in this case is 20.</p>
<h4 id="loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops"><a class="header" href="#loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops">Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops</a></h4>
<p>If you have loops within loops, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> apply to the innermost
loop at that point. You can optionally specify a <em>loop label</em> on a loop that we
can then use with <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> to specify that those keywords apply to
the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin with a
single quote. Here’s an example with two nested loops:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!(&quot;count = {count}&quot;);
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!(&quot;remaining = {remaining}&quot;);
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!(&quot;End count = {count}&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The outer loop has the label <code>'counting_up</code>, and it will count up from 0 to 2.
The inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9. The first <code>break</code> that
doesn’t specify a label will exit the inner loop only. The <code>break 'counting_up;</code> statement will exit the outer loop. This code prints:</p>

End count = 2
</code></pre>
<h4 id="conditional-loops-with-while"><a class="header" href="#conditional-loops-with-while">Conditional Loops with <code>while</code></a></h4>
<p>A program will often need to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the
condition is true, the loop runs. When the condition ceases to be true, the
program calls <code>break</code>, stopping the loop. It’s possible to implement behavior
like this using a combination of <code>loop</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>break</code>; you could
try that now in a program, if you’d like. However, this pattern is so common
that Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a <code>while</code> loop. In
Listing 3-3, we use <code>while</code> to loop the program three times, counting down each
time, and then, after the loop, print a message and exit.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {

<p>This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used

true, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.</p>

<p>You can choose to use the <code>while</code> construct to loop over the elements of a
collection, such as an array. For example, the loop in Listing 3-4 prints each
element in the array <code>a</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index &lt; 5 {
        println!(&quot;the value is: {}&quot;, a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 3-4: Looping through each element of a collection
using a <code>while</code> loop</span></p>
<p>Here, the code counts up through the elements in the array. It starts at index
<code>0</code>, and then loops until it reaches the final index in the array (that is,
when <code>index &lt; 5</code> is no longer true). Running this code will print every element
in the array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32s
     Running `target/debug/loops`
the value is: 10
the value is: 20
the value is: 30
the value is: 40
the value is: 50
</code></pre>
<p>All five array values appear in the terminal, as expected. Even though <code>index</code>
will reach a value of <code>5</code> at some point, the loop stops executing before trying
to fetch a sixth value from the array.</p>
<p>However, this approach is error prone; we could cause the program to panic if
the index value or test condition are incorrect. For example, if you changed
the definition of the <code>a</code> array to have four elements but forgot to update the
condition to <code>while index &lt; 4</code>, the code would panic. It’s also slow, because
the compiler adds runtime code to perform the conditional check of whether the
index is within the bounds of the array on every iteration through the loop.</p>
<p>As a more concise alternative, you can use a <code>for</code> loop and execute some code
for each item in a collection. A <code>for</code> loop looks like the code in Listing 3-5.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!(&quot;the value is: {element}&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 3-5: Looping through each element of a collection
using a <code>for</code> loop</span></p>
<p>When we run this code, we’ll see the same output as in Listing 3-4. More
importantly, we’ve now increased the safety of the code and eliminated the
chance of bugs that might result from going beyond the end of the array or not
going far enough and missing some items.</p>
<p>Using the <code>for</code> loop, you wouldn’t need to remember to change any other code if
you changed the number of values in the array, as you would with the method
used in Listing 3-4.</p>
<p>The safety and conciseness of <code>for</code> loops make them the most commonly used loop
construct in Rust. Even in situations in which you want to run some code a
certain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a <code>while</code> loop
in Listing 3-3, most Rustaceans would use a <code>for</code> loop. The way to do that
would be to use a <code>Range</code>, provided by the standard library, which generates
all numbers in sequence starting from one number and ending before another
number.</p>
<p>Here’s what the countdown would look like using a <code>for</code> loop and another method
we’ve not yet talked about, <code>rev</code>, to reverse the range:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!(&quot;{number}!&quot;);
    }
    println!(&quot;LIFTOFF!!!&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>

<p>Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest
of the language. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without
needing a garbage collector, so it’s important to understand how ownership
works. In this chapter, we’ll talk about ownership as well as several related
features: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data out in memory.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="what-is-ownership"><a class="header" href="#what-is-ownership">What Is Ownership?</a></h2>
<p><em>Ownership</em> is a set of rules that governs how a Rust program manages memory.
All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while running.
Some languages have garbage collection that regularly looks for no-longer used
memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly
allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed
through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. If
any of the rules are violated, the program won’t compile. None of the features
of ownership will slow down your program while it’s running.</p>
<p>Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time
to get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with Rust
and the rules of the ownership system, the easier you’ll find it to naturally
develop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!</p>
<p>When you understand ownership, you’ll have a solid foundation for understanding
the features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, you’ll learn ownership by
working through some examples that focus on a very common data structure:
strings.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="the-stack-and-the-heap"><a class="header" href="#the-stack-and-the-heap">The Stack and the Heap</a></h3>
<p>Many programming languages don’t require you to think about the stack and the
heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a
value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why
you have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be described in
relation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here is a brief
explanation in preparation.</p>
<p>Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use
at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores
values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite
order. This is referred to as <em>last in, first out</em>. Think of a stack of
plates: when you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when
you need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from
the middle or bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called <em>pushing
onto the stack</em>, and removing data is called <em>popping off the stack</em>. All
data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown
size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap
instead.</p>
<p>The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a
certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap
that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a <em>pointer</em>, which
is the address of that location. This process is called <em>allocating on the
heap</em> and is sometimes abbreviated as just <em>allocating</em> (pushing values onto
the stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the heap is a
known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want
the actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a
restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and
the staff finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If
someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve been seated to
find you.</p>
<p>Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the
allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is
always at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap
requires more work, because the allocator must first find a big enough space
to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next
allocation.</p>
<p>Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because
you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster
if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server
at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get
all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an
order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and
then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a
processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other
data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the
heap).</p>
<p>When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function
(including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s
local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those
values get popped off the stack.</p>
<p>Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,
minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused
data on the heap so you don’t run out of space are all problems that ownership
addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think about the
stack and the heap very often, but knowing that the main purpose of ownership
is to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it does.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ownership-rules"><a class="header" href="#ownership-rules">Ownership Rules</a></h3>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we
work through the examples that illustrate them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each value in Rust has an <em>owner</em>.</li>
<li>There can only be one owner at a time.</li>
<li>When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="variable-scope"><a class="header" href="#variable-scope">Variable Scope</a></h3>
<p>Now that we’re past basic Rust syntax, we won’t include all the <code>fn main() {</code>
code in examples, so if you’re following along, make sure to put the following
examples inside a <code>main</code> function manually. As a result, our examples will be a
bit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details rather than
boilerplate code.</p>
<p>As a first example of ownership, we’ll look at the <em>scope</em> of some variables. A
scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Take the
following variable:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = &quot;hello&quot;;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The variable <code>s</code> refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is
hardcoded into the text of our program. The variable is valid from the point at
which it’s declared until the end of the current <em>scope</em>. Listing 4-1 shows a
program with comments annotating where the variable <code>s</code> would be valid.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    {                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
        let s = &quot;hello&quot;;   // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-1: A variable and the scope in which it is
valid</span></p>
<p>In other words, there are two important points in time here:</p>
<ul>
<li>When <code>s</code> comes <em>into scope</em>, it is valid.</li>
<li>It remains valid until it goes <em>out of scope</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is
similar to that in other programming languages. Now we’ll build on top of this
understanding by introducing the <code>String</code> type.</p>
<h3 id="the-string-type"><a class="header" href="#the-string-type">The <code>String</code> Type</a></h3>
<p>To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more complex
than those we covered in the <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types">“Data Types”</a><!-- ignore --> section
of Chapter 3. The types covered previously are all a known size, can be stored
on the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, and can be
quickly and trivially copied to make a new, independent instance if another
part of code needs to use the same value in a different scope. But we want to
look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to
clean up that data, and the <code>String</code> type is a great example.</p>
<p>We’ll concentrate on the parts of <code>String</code> that relate to ownership. These
aspects also apply to other complex data types, whether they are provided by
the standard library or created by you. We’ll discuss <code>String</code> in more depth in
<a href="ch08-02-strings.html">Chapter 8</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our
program. String literals are convenient, but they aren’t suitable for every
situation in which we may want to use text. One reason is that they’re
immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write
our code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it? For
these situations, Rust has a second string type, <code>String</code>. This type manages
data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that
is unknown to us at compile time. You can create a <code>String</code> from a string
literal using the <code>from</code> function, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The double colon <code>::</code> operator allows us to namespace this particular <code>from</code>
function under the <code>String</code> type rather than using some sort of name like
<code>string_from</code>. We’ll discuss this syntax more in the <a href="ch05-03-method-syntax.html#method-syntax">“Method
Syntax”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 5 and when we talk
about namespacing with modules in <a href="ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html">“Paths for Referring to an Item in the
Module Tree”</a><!-- ignore --> in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>This kind of string <em>can</em> be mutated:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    s.push_str(&quot;, world!&quot;); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, s); // This will print `hello, world!`
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>So, what’s the difference here? Why can <code>String</code> be mutated but literals
cannot? The difference is how these two types deal with memory.</p>
<h3 id="memory-and-allocation"><a class="header" href="#memory-and-allocation">Memory and Allocation</a></h3>
<p>In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the
text is hardcoded directly into the final executable. This is why string
literals are fast and efficient. But these properties only come from the string
literal’s immutability. Unfortunately, we can’t put a blob of memory into the
binary for each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose
size might change while running the program.</p>
<p>With the <code>String</code> type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text,
we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time,
to hold the contents. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.</li>
<li>We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re
done with our <code>String</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That first part is done by us: when we call <code>String::from</code>, its implementation
requests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming
languages.</p>
<p>However, the second part is different. In languages with a <em>garbage collector
(GC)</em>, the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn’t being used
anymore, and we don’t need to think about it. In most languages without a GC,
it’s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and
call code to explicitly free it, just as we did to request it. Doing this
correctly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget,
we’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If
we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one <code>allocate</code> with
exactly one <code>free</code>.</p>
<p>Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the
variable that owns it goes out of scope. Here’s a version of our scope example
from Listing 4-1 using a <code>String</code> instead of a string literal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    {
        let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;); // s is valid from this point forward

        // do stuff with s
    }                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                       // longer valid
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our <code>String</code> needs
to the allocator: when <code>s</code> goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of
scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called
<a href="../std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop"><code>drop</code></a><!-- ignore -->, and it’s where the author of <code>String</code> can put
the code to return the memory. Rust calls <code>drop</code> automatically at the closing
curly bracket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item’s
lifetime is sometimes called <em>Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)</em>.
The <code>drop</code> function in Rust will be familiar to you if you’ve used RAII
patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It may seem
simple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more
complicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data
we’ve allocated on the heap. Let’s explore some of those situations now.</p>
<h4 id="ways-variables-and-data-interact-move"><a class="header" href="#ways-variables-and-data-interact-move">Ways Variables and Data Interact: Move</a></h4>
<p>Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.
Let’s look at an example using an integer in Listing 4-2.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let x = 5;
    let y = x;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-2: Assigning the integer value of variable <code>x</code>
to <code>y</code></span></p>
<p>We can probably guess what this is doing: “bind the value <code>5</code> to <code>x</code>; then make
a copy of the value in <code>x</code> and bind it to <code>y</code>.” We now have two variables, <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code>, and both equal <code>5</code>. This is indeed what is happening, because integers
are simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two <code>5</code> values are pushed
onto the stack.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the <code>String</code> version:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    let s2 = s1;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This looks very similar, so we might assume that the way it works would be the
same: that is, the second line would make a copy of the value in <code>s1</code> and bind
it to <code>s2</code>. But this isn’t quite what happens.</p>
<p>Take a look at Figure 4-1 to see what is happening to <code>String</code> under the
covers. A <code>String</code> is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to
the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity.
This group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the
heap that holds the contents.</p>
<img alt="String in memory" src="img/trpl04-01.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" />
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-1: Representation in memory of a <code>String</code>
holding the value <code>&quot;hello&quot;</code> bound to <code>s1</code></span></p>
<p>The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the <code>String</code> is
currently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the
<code>String</code> has received from the allocator. The difference between length
and capacity matters, but not in this context, so for now, it’s fine to ignore
the capacity.</p>
<p>When we assign <code>s1</code> to <code>s2</code>, the <code>String</code> data is copied, meaning we copy the
pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the
data on the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data
representation in memory looks like Figure 4-2.</p>
<img alt="s1 and s2 pointing to the same value" src="img/trpl04-02.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" />
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-2: Representation in memory of the variable <code>s2</code>
that has a copy of the pointer, length, and capacity of <code>s1</code></span></p>
<p>The representation does <em>not</em> look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory would
look like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the
operation <code>s2 = s1</code> could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if
the data on the heap were large.</p>
<img alt="s1 and s2 to two places" src="img/trpl04-03.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" />
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-3: Another possibility for what <code>s2 = s1</code> might
do if Rust copied the heap data as well</span></p>
<p>Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically
calls the <code>drop</code> function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. But
Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a
problem: when <code>s2</code> and <code>s1</code> go out of scope, they will both try to free the
same memory. This is known as a <em>double free</em> error and is one of the memory
safety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory
corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>To ensure memory safety, after the line <code>let s2 = s1</code>, Rust considers <code>s1</code> as
no longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when <code>s1</code> goes
out of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use <code>s1</code> after <code>s2</code> is
created; it won’t work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    let s2 = s1;

    println!(&quot;{}, world!&quot;, s1);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>You’ll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the
invalidated reference:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<p>If you’ve heard the terms <em>shallow copy</em> and <em>deep copy</em> while working with
other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity
without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But
because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of calling it a
shallow copy, it’s known as a <em>move</em>. In this example, we would say that
<code>s1</code> was <em>moved</em> into <code>s2</code>. So what actually happens is shown in Figure 4-4.</p>
<img alt="s1 moved to s2" src="img/trpl04-04.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" />
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-4: Representation in memory after <code>s1</code> has been
invalidated</span></p>
<p>That solves our problem! With only <code>s2</code> valid, when it goes out of scope, it
alone will free the memory, and we’re done.</p>
<p>In addition, there’s a design choice that’s implied by this: Rust will never
automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any <em>automatic</em>
copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.</p>

<h4 id="ways-variables-and-data-interact-clone"><a class="header" href="#ways-variables-and-data-interact-clone">Ways Variables and Data Interact: Clone</a></h4>
<p>If we <em>do</em> want to deeply copy the heap data of the <code>String</code>, not just the
stack data, we can use a common method called <code>clone</code>. We’ll discuss method
syntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many
programming languages, you’ve probably seen them before.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the <code>clone</code> method in action:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
    let s2 = s1.clone();

    println!(&quot;s1 = {}, s2 = {}&quot;, s1, s2);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3,
where the heap data <em>does</em> get copied.</p>
<p>When you see a call to <code>clone</code>, you know that some arbitrary code is being
executed and that code may be expensive. It’s a visual indicator that something
different is going on.</p>
<h4 id="stack-only-data-copy"><a class="header" href="#stack-only-data-copy">Stack-Only Data: Copy</a></h4>
<p>There’s another wrinkle we haven’t talked about yet. This code using integers –
part of which was shown in Listing 4-2 – works and is valid:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let x = 5;
    let y = x;

    println!(&quot;x = {}, y = {}&quot;, x, y);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don’t have a call to
<code>clone</code>, but <code>x</code> is still valid and wasn’t moved into <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile
time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick
to make. That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent <code>x</code> from being
valid after we create the variable <code>y</code>. In other words, there’s no difference
between deep and shallow copying here, so calling <code>clone</code> wouldn’t do anything
different from the usual shallow copying and we can leave it out.</p>
<p>Rust has a special annotation called the <code>Copy</code> trait that we can place on
types that are stored on the stack, as integers are (we’ll talk more about
traits in <a href="ch10-02-traits.html">Chapter 10</a><!-- ignore -->). If a type implements the <code>Copy</code>
trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied,
making them still valid after assignment to another variable.</p>
<p>Rust won’t let us annotate a type with <code>Copy</code> if the type, or any of its parts,
has implemented the <code>Drop</code> trait. If the type needs something special to happen
when the value goes out of scope and we add the <code>Copy</code> annotation to that type,
we’ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the <code>Copy</code> annotation
to your type to implement the trait, see <a href="appendix-03-derivable-traits.html">“Derivable
Traits”</a><!-- ignore --> in Appendix C.</p>
<p>So what types implement the <code>Copy</code> trait? You can check the documentation for
the given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar
values can implement <code>Copy</code>, and nothing that requires allocation or is some
form of resource can implement <code>Copy</code>. Here are some of the types that
implement <code>Copy</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the integer types, such as <code>u32</code>.</li>
<li>The Boolean type, <code>bool</code>, with values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>All the floating point types, such as <code>f64</code>.</li>
<li>The character type, <code>char</code>.</li>
<li>Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement <code>Copy</code>. For example,
<code>(i32, i32)</code> implements <code>Copy</code>, but <code>(i32, String)</code> does not.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ownership-and-functions"><a class="header" href="#ownership-and-functions">Ownership and Functions</a></h3>
<p>The mechanics of passing a value to a function are similar to those when
assigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or
copy, just as assignment does. Listing 4-3 has an example with some annotations
showing where variables go into and out of scope.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-3: Functions with ownership and scope
annotated</span></p>
<p>If we tried to use <code>s</code> after the call to <code>takes_ownership</code>, Rust would throw a
compile-time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. Try adding
code to <code>main</code> that uses <code>s</code> and <code>x</code> to see where you can use them and where
the ownership rules prevent you from doing so.</p>
<h3 id="return-values-and-scope"><a class="header" href="#return-values-and-scope">Return Values and Scope</a></h3>
<p>Returning values can also transfer ownership. Listing 4-4 shows an example
of a function that returns some value, with similar annotations as those in
Listing 4-3.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-4: Transferring ownership of return
values</span></p>
<p>The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a
value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the
heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by <code>drop</code> unless ownership
of the data has been moved to another variable.</p>
<p>While this works, taking ownership and then returning ownership with every
function is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but
not take ownership? It’s quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to
be passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting
from the body of the function that we might want to return as well.</p>
<p>Rust does let us return multiple values using a tuple, as shown in Listing 4-5.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {

}

fn calculate_length(s: String) -&gt; (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String

    (s, length)
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-5: Returning ownership of parameters</span></p>
<p>But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be
common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for using a value without
transferring ownership, called <em>references</em>.</p>

<p>The issue with the tuple code in Listing 4-5 is that we have to return the
<code>String</code> to the calling function so we can still use the <code>String</code> after the
call to <code>calculate_length</code>, because the <code>String</code> was moved into
<code>calculate_length</code>. Instead, we can provide a reference to the <code>String</code> value.
A <em>reference</em> is like a pointer in that it’s an address we can follow to access
the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable.
Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a
particular type for the life of that reference.</p>
<p>Here is how you would define and use a <code>calculate_length</code> function that
has a reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the
value:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let len = calculate_length(&amp;s1);

    println!(&quot;The length of '{}' is {}.&quot;, s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {
    s.len()
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>First, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and the
function return value is gone. Second, note that we pass <code>&amp;s1</code> into
<code>calculate_length</code> and, in its definition, we take <code>&amp;String</code> rather than
<code>String</code>. These ampersands represent <em>references</em>, and they allow you to refer
to some value without taking ownership of it. Figure 4-5 depicts this concept.</p>
<img alt="&amp;String s pointing at String s1" src="img/trpl04-05.svg" class="center" />
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-5: A diagram of <code>&amp;String s</code> pointing at <code>String s1</code></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The opposite of referencing by using <code>&amp;</code> is <em>dereferencing</em>, which is
accomplished with the dereference operator, <code>*</code>. We’ll see some uses of the
dereference operator in Chapter 8 and discuss details of dereferencing in
Chapter 15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the function call here:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let len = calculate_length(&amp;s1);
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;The length of '{}' is {}.&quot;, s1, len);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn calculate_length(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {
</span><span class="boring">    s.len()
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>&amp;s1</code> syntax lets us create a reference that <em>refers</em> to the value of <code>s1</code>
but does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will
not be dropped when the reference stops being used.</p>
<p>Likewise, the signature of the function uses <code>&amp;</code> to indicate that the type of
the parameter <code>s</code> is a reference. Let’s add some explanatory annotations:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let s1 = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let len = calculate_length(&amp;s1);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;The length of '{}' is {}.&quot;, s1, len);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn calculate_length(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize { // s is a reference to a String
    s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what
  // it refers to, it is not dropped.
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The scope in which the variable <code>s</code> is valid is the same as any function
parameter’s scope, but the value pointed to by the reference is not dropped
when <code>s</code> stops being used because <code>s</code> doesn’t have ownership. When functions
have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won’t need to
return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had
ownership.</p>
<p>We call the action of creating a reference <em>borrowing</em>. As in real life, if a
person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have
to give it back. You don’t own it.</p>
<p>So what happens if we try to modify something we’re borrowing? Try the code in

</code></pre>
<p>This error says that this code is invalid because we cannot borrow <code>s</code> as
mutable more than once at a time. The first mutable borrow is in <code>r1</code> and must
last until it’s used in the <code>println!</code>, but between the creation of that
mutable reference and its usage, we tried to create another mutable reference
in <code>r2</code> that borrows the same data as <code>r1</code>.</p>
<p>The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the
same time allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion. It’s something
that new Rustaceans struggle with, because most languages let you mutate
whenever you’d like. The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can
prevent data races at compile time. A <em>data race</em> is similar to a race
condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.</li>
<li>At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.</li>
<li>There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix
when you’re trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this problem
by refusing to compile code with data races!</p>
<p>As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for
multiple mutable references, just not <em>simultaneous</em> ones:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    {
        let r1 = &amp;mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &amp;mut s;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references.
This code results in an error:</p>

<p>Whew! We <em>also</em> cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one
to the same value.</p>
<p>Users of an immutable reference don’t expect the value to suddenly change out
from under them! However, multiple immutable references are allowed because no
one who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else’s
reading of the data.</p>
<p>Note that a reference’s scope starts from where it is introduced and continues
through the last time that reference is used. For instance, this code will
compile because the last usage of the immutable references, the <code>println!</code>,
occurs before the mutable reference is introduced:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust edition2021"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    let r1 = &amp;s; // no problem
    let r2 = &amp;s; // no problem
    println!(&quot;{} and {}&quot;, r1, r2);
    // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point

    let r3 = &amp;mut s; // no problem
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, r3);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The scopes of the immutable references <code>r1</code> and <code>r2</code> end after the <code>println!</code>
where they are last used, which is before the mutable reference <code>r3</code> is
created. These scopes don’t overlap, so this code is allowed. The ability of
the compiler to tell that a reference is no longer being used at a point before
the end of the scope is called <em>Non-Lexical Lifetimes</em> (NLL for short), and you
can read more about it in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/ownership-and-lifetimes/non-lexical-lifetimes.html">The Edition Guide</a>.</p>
<p>Even though borrowing errors may be frustrating at times, remember that it’s
the Rust compiler pointing out a potential bug early (at compile time rather
than at runtime) and showing you exactly where the problem is. Then you don’t
have to track down why your data isn’t what you thought it was.</p>

<p>In languages with pointers, it’s easy to erroneously create a <em>dangling
pointer</em>--a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been
given to someone else--by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to
that memory. In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will
never be dangling references: if you have a reference to some data, the
compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the
reference to the data does.</p>
<p>Let’s try to create a dangling reference to see how Rust prevents them with a
compile-time error:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

</code></pre>
<p>This error message refers to a feature we haven’t covered yet: lifetimes. We’ll
discuss lifetimes in detail in Chapter 10. But, if you disregard the parts
about lifetimes, the message does contain the key to why this code is a problem:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value
for it to be borrowed from
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at exactly what’s happening at each stage of our
<code>dangle</code> code:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn dangle() -&gt; &amp;String { // dangle returns a reference to a String

    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;); // s is a new String

    &amp;s // we return a reference to the String, s
} // Here, s goes out of scope, and is dropped. Its memory goes away.
  // Danger!
</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>s</code> is created inside <code>dangle</code>, when the code of <code>dangle</code> is finished,
<code>s</code> will be deallocated. But we tried to return a reference to it. That means
this reference would be pointing to an invalid <code>String</code>. That’s no good! Rust
won’t let us do this.</p>
<p>The solution here is to return the <code>String</code> directly:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let string = no_dangle();

    let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

    s

<p>This works without any problems. Ownership is moved out, and nothing is
deallocated.</p>
<h3 id="the-rules-of-references"><a class="header" href="#the-rules-of-references">The Rules of References</a></h3>
<p>Let’s recap what we’ve discussed about references:</p>
<ul>
<li>At any given time, you can have <em>either</em> one mutable reference <em>or</em> any
number of immutable references.</li>
<li>References must always be valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we’ll look at a different kind of reference: slices.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="mdbook-quiz/embed.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mdbook-quiz/embed.css"><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="the-slice-type"><a class="header" href="#the-slice-type">The Slice Type</a></h2>
<p><em>Slices</em> let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection
rather than the whole collection. A slice is a kind of reference, so it does
not have ownership.</p>
<p>Here’s a small programming problem: write a function that takes a string of
words separated by spaces and returns the first word it finds in that string.
If the function doesn’t find a space in the string, the whole string must be
one word, so the entire string should be returned.</p>
<p>Let’s work through how we’d write the signature of this function without using
slices, to understand the problem that slices will solve:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; ?
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>first_word</code> function has a <code>&amp;String</code> as a parameter. We don’t want
ownership, so this is fine. But what should we return? We don’t really have a
way to talk about <em>part</em> of a string. However, we could return the index of the
end of the word, indicated by a space. Let’s try that, as shown in Listing 4-7.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &amp;item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return i;
        }
    }

    s.len()
}
<span class="boring">

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-7: The <code>first_word</code> function that returns a
byte index value into the <code>String</code> parameter</span></p>
<p>Because we need to go through the <code>String</code> element by element and check whether
a value is a space, we’ll convert our <code>String</code> to an array of bytes using the
<code>as_bytes</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {

</span><span class="boring">    s.len()
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Next, we create an iterator over the array of bytes using the <code>iter</code> method:</p>

</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We’ll discuss iterators in more detail in <a href="ch13-02-iterators.html">Chapter 13</a><!-- ignore -->.
For now, know that <code>iter</code> is a method that returns each element in a collection
and that <code>enumerate</code> wraps the result of <code>iter</code> and returns each element as
part of a tuple instead. The first element of the tuple returned from
<code>enumerate</code> is the index, and the second element is a reference to the element.
This is a bit more convenient than calculating the index ourselves.</p>
<p>Because the <code>enumerate</code> method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to
destructure that tuple. We’ll be discussing patterns more in <a href="ch06-02-match.html#patterns-that-bind-to-values">Chapter
6</a><!-- ignore -->. In the <code>for</code> loop, we specify a pattern that has <code>i</code>
for the index in the tuple and <code>&amp;item</code> for the single byte in the tuple.
Because we get a reference to the element from <code>.iter().enumerate()</code>, we use
<code>&amp;</code> in the pattern.</p>
<p>Inside the <code>for</code> loop, we search for the byte that represents the space by
using the byte literal syntax. If we find a space, we return the position.
Otherwise, we return the length of the string by using <code>s.len()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; usize {
</span><span class="boring">    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    }

    s.len()
<span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre>
<p>We now have a way to find out the index of the end of the first word in the
string, but there’s a problem. We’re returning a <code>usize</code> on its own, but it’s
only a meaningful number in the context of the <code>&amp;String</code>. In other words,
because it’s a separate value from the <code>String</code>, there’s no guarantee that it
will still be valid in the future. Consider the program in Listing 4-8 that
uses the <code>first_word</code> function from Listing 4-7.</p>

    s.clear(); // this empties the String, making it equal to &quot;&quot;

    // word still has the value 5 here, but there's no more string that

}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 4-8: Storing the result from calling the
<code>first_word</code> function and then changing the <code>String</code> contents</span></p>
<p>This program compiles without any errors and would also do so if we used <code>word</code>
after calling <code>s.clear()</code>. Because <code>word</code> isn’t connected to the state of <code>s</code>
at all, <code>word</code> still contains the value <code>5</code>. We could use that value <code>5</code> with
the variable <code>s</code> to try to extract the first word out, but this would be a bug
because the contents of <code>s</code> have changed since we saved <code>5</code> in <code>word</code>.</p>
<p>Having to worry about the index in <code>word</code> getting out of sync with the data in
<code>s</code> is tedious and error prone! Managing these indices is even more brittle if
we write a <code>second_word</code> function. Its signature would have to look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn second_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; (usize, usize) {
</code></pre>
<p>Now we’re tracking a starting <em>and</em> an ending index, and we have even more
values that were calculated from data in a particular state but aren’t tied to
that state at all. We have three unrelated variables floating around that
need to be kept in sync.</p>
<p>Luckily, Rust has a solution to this problem: string slices.</p>
<h3 id="string-slices"><a class="header" href="#string-slices">String Slices</a></h3>
<p>A <em>string slice</em> is a reference to part of a <code>String</code>, and it looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s = String::from(&quot;hello world&quot;);

    let hello = &amp;s[0..5];
    let world = &amp;s[6..11];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Rather than a reference to the entire <code>String</code>, <code>hello</code> is a reference to a
portion of the <code>String</code>, specified in the extra <code>[0..5]</code> bit. We create slices
using a range within brackets by specifying <code>[starting_index..ending_index]</code>,
where <code>starting_index</code> is the first position in the slice and <code>ending_index</code> is
one more than the last position in the slice. Internally, the slice data
structure stores the starting position and the length of the slice, which
corresponds to <code>ending_index</code> minus <code>starting_index</code>. So in the case of <code>let world = &amp;s[6..11];</code>, <code>world</code> would be a slice that contains a pointer to the
byte at index 6 of <code>s</code> with a length value of 5.</p>
<p>Figure 4-6 shows this in a diagram.</p>
<img alt="world containing a pointer to the byte at index 6 of String s and a length 5" src="img/trpl04-06.svg" class="center" style="width: 50%;" />
<p><span class="caption">Figure 4-6: String slice referring to part of a
<code>String</code></span></p>
<p>With Rust’s <code>..</code> range syntax, if you want to start at index zero, you can drop
the value before the two periods. In other words, these are equal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

let slice = &amp;s[0..2];
let slice = &amp;s[..2];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>By the same token, if your slice includes the last byte of the <code>String</code>, you
can drop the trailing number. That means these are equal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

let len = s.len();

let slice = &amp;s[3..len];
let slice = &amp;s[3..];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>You can also drop both values to take a slice of the entire string. So these
are equal:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = String::from(&quot;hello&quot;);

let len = s.len();

let slice = &amp;s[0..len];
let slice = &amp;s[..];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: String slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character
boundaries. If you attempt to create a string slice in the middle of a
multibyte character, your program will exit with an error. For the purposes
of introducing string slices, we are assuming ASCII only in this section; a
more thorough discussion of UTF-8 handling is in the <a href="ch08-02-strings.html#storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings">“Storing UTF-8 Encoded
Text with Strings”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all this information in mind, let’s rewrite <code>first_word</code> to return a
slice. The type that signifies “string slice” is written as <code>&amp;str</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &amp;item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &amp;s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &amp;s[..]
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We get the index for the end of the word in the same way as we did in Listing
4-7, by looking for the first occurrence of a space. When we find a space, we
return a string slice using the start of the string and the index of the space
as the starting and ending indices.</p>
<p>Now when we call <code>first_word</code>, we get back a single value that is tied to the
underlying data. The value is made up of a reference to the starting point of
the slice and the number of elements in the slice.</p>
<p>Returning a slice would also work for a <code>second_word</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn second_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>We now have a straightforward API that’s much harder to mess up, because the
compiler will ensure the references into the <code>String</code> remain valid. Remember
the bug in the program in Listing 4-8, when we got the index to the end of the
first word but then cleared the string so our index was invalid? That code was
logically incorrect but didn’t show any immediate errors. The problems would
show up later if we kept trying to use the first word index with an emptied
string. Slices make this bug impossible and let us know we have a problem with
our code much sooner. Using the slice version of <code>first_word</code> will throw a
compile-time error:</p>

<p>Recall from the borrowing rules that if we have an immutable reference to
something, we cannot also take a mutable reference. Because <code>clear</code> needs to
truncate the <code>String</code>, it needs to get a mutable reference. The <code>println!</code>
after the call to <code>clear</code> uses the reference in <code>word</code>, so the immutable
reference must still be active at that point. Rust disallows the mutable
reference in <code>clear</code> and the immutable reference in <code>word</code> from existing at the
same time, and compilation fails. Not only has Rust made our API easier to use,
but it has also eliminated an entire class of errors at compile time!</p>
<h4 id="string-literals-are-slices"><a class="header" href="#string-literals-are-slices">String Literals Are Slices</a></h4>
<p>Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary. Now
that we know about slices, we can properly understand string literals:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The type of <code>s</code> here is <code>&amp;str</code>: it’s a slice pointing to that specific point of
the binary. This is also why string literals are immutable; <code>&amp;str</code> is an
immutable reference.</p>
<h4 id="string-slices-as-parameters"><a class="header" href="#string-slices-as-parameters">String Slices as Parameters</a></h4>
<p>Knowing that you can take slices of literals and <code>String</code> values leads us to
one more improvement on <code>first_word</code>, and that’s its signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word(s: &amp;String) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>A more experienced Rustacean would write the signature shown in Listing 4-9
instead because it allows us to use the same function on both <code>&amp;String</code> values
and <code>&amp;str</code> values.</p>

<h3 id="other-slices"><a class="header" href="#other-slices">Other Slices</a></h3>
<p>String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there’s a
more general slice type, too. Consider this array:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

<p>Just as we might want to refer to a part of a string, we might want to refer
to part of an array. We’d do so like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let slice = &amp;a[1..3];

assert_eq!(slice, &amp;[2, 3]);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This slice has the type <code>&amp;[i32]</code>. It works the same way as string slices do, by
storing a reference to the first element and a length. You’ll use this kind of
slice for all sorts of other collections. We’ll discuss these collections in
detail when we talk about vectors in Chapter 8.</p>

<h2 id="summary-3"><a class="header" href="#summary-3">Summary</a></h2>
<p>The concepts of ownership, borrowing, and slices ensure memory safety in Rust
programs at compile time. The Rust language gives you control over your memory
usage in the same way as other systems programming languages, but having the
owner of data automatically clean up that data when the owner goes out of scope
means you don’t have to write and debug extra code to get this control.</p>
<p>Ownership affects how lots of other parts of Rust work, so we’ll talk about
these concepts further throughout the rest of the book. Let’s move on to
Chapter 5 and look at grouping pieces of data together in a <code>struct</code>.</p>

<p>A <em>struct</em>, or <em>structure</em>, is a custom data type that lets you package
together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. If
you’re familiar with an object-oriented language, a <em>struct</em> is like an
object’s data attributes. In this chapter, we’ll compare and contrast tuples
with structs to build on what you already know and demonstrate when structs are
a better way to group data.</p>
<p>We’ll demonstrate how to define and instantiate structs. We’ll discuss how to
define associated functions, especially the kind of associated functions called
<em>methods</em>, to specify behavior associated with a struct type. Structs and enums
(discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new types in your
program’s domain to take full advantage of Rust’s compile time type checking.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="defining-and-instantiating-structs"><a class="header" href="#defining-and-instantiating-structs">Defining and Instantiating Structs</a></h2>
<p>Structs are similar to tuples, discussed in <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type">“The Tuple Type”</a><!--
ignore --> section, in that both hold multiple related values. Like tuples, the
pieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike with tuples, in a struct
you’ll name each piece of data so it’s clear what the values mean. Adding these
names means that structs are more flexible than tuples: you don’t have to rely
on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.</p>
<p>To define a struct, we enter the keyword <code>struct</code> and name the entire struct. A
struct’s name should describe the significance of the pieces of data being
grouped together. Then, inside curly brackets, we define the names and types of
the pieces of data, which we call <em>fields</em>. For example, Listing 5-1 shows a
struct that stores information about a user account.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-1: A <code>User</code> struct definition</span></p>
<p>To use a struct after we’ve defined it, we create an <em>instance</em> of that struct
by specifying concrete values for each of the fields. We create an instance by
stating the name of the struct and then add curly brackets containing <code>key: value</code> pairs, where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are the
data we want to store in those fields. We don’t have to specify the fields in
the same order in which we declared them in the struct. In other words, the
struct definition is like a general template for the type, and instances fill
in that template with particular data to create values of the type. For
example, we can declare a particular user as shown in Listing 5-2.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">struct User {
</span><span class="boring">    active: bool,

<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-2: Creating an instance of the <code>User</code>
struct</span></p>
<p>To get a specific value from a struct, we use dot notation. For example, to
access this user’s email address, we use <code>user1.email</code>. If the instance is
mutable, we can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a
particular field. Listing 5-3 shows how to change the value in the <code>email</code>
field of a mutable <code>User</code> instance.</p>

implicitly return that new instance.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-7: Using struct update syntax to set a new
<code>email</code> value for a <code>User</code> instance but use the rest of the values from

<p>The code in Listing 5-7 also creates an instance in <code>user2</code> that has a
different value for <code>email</code> but has the same values for the <code>username</code>,
<code>active</code>, and <code>sign_in_count</code> fields from <code>user1</code>. The <code>..user1</code> must come last
to specify that any remaining fields should get their values from the
corresponding fields in <code>user1</code>, but we can choose to specify values for as
many fields as we want in any order, regardless of the order of the fields in
the struct’s definition.</p>
<p>Note that the struct update syntax uses <code>=</code> like an assignment; this is
because it moves the data, just as we saw in the <a href="ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ways-variables-and-data-interact-move">“Ways Variables and Data
Interact: Move”</a><!-- ignore --> section. In this example, we can no
longer use <code>user1</code> after creating <code>user2</code> because the <code>String</code> in the
<code>username</code> field of <code>user1</code> was moved into <code>user2</code>. If we had given <code>user2</code> new
<code>String</code> values for both <code>email</code> and <code>username</code>, and thus only used the
<code>active</code> and <code>sign_in_count</code> values from <code>user1</code>, then <code>user1</code> would still be
valid after creating <code>user2</code>. The types of <code>active</code> and <code>sign_in_count</code> are
types that implement the <code>Copy</code> trait, so the behavior we discussed in the
<a href="ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#stack-only-data-copy">“Stack-Only Data: Copy”</a><!-- ignore --> section would apply.</p>

<p>Rust also supports structs that look similar to tuples, called <em>tuple
structs</em>. Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but
don’t have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types
of the fields. Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a
name and make the tuple a different type from other tuples, and when naming each
field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.</p>
<p>To define a tuple struct, start with the <code>struct</code> keyword and the struct name
followed by the types in the tuple. For example, here we define and use
two tuple structs named <code>Color</code> and <code>Point</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>black</code> and <code>origin</code> values are different types, because they’re
instances of different tuple structs. Each struct you define is its own type,
even though the fields within the struct might have the same types. For
example, a function that takes a parameter of type <code>Color</code> cannot take a
<code>Point</code> as an argument, even though both types are made up of three <code>i32</code>
values. Otherwise, tuple struct instances are similar to tuples in that you can
destructure them into their individual pieces, and you can use a <code>.</code> followed
by the index to access an individual value.</p>
<h3 id="unit-like-structs-without-any-fields"><a class="header" href="#unit-like-structs-without-any-fields">Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields</a></h3>
<p>You can also define structs that don’t have any fields! These are called
<em>unit-like structs</em> because they behave similarly to <code>()</code>, the unit type that
we mentioned in <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type">“The Tuple Type”</a><!-- ignore --> section. Unit-like
structs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t
have any data that you want to store in the type itself. We’ll discuss traits
in Chapter 10. Here’s an example of declaring and instantiating a unit struct
named <code>AlwaysEqual</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>To define <code>AlwaysEqual</code>, we use the <code>struct</code> keyword, the name we want, then a
semicolon. No need for curly brackets or parentheses! Then we can get an
instance of <code>AlwaysEqual</code> in the <code>subject</code> variable in a similar way: using the
name we defined, without any curly brackets or parentheses. Imagine that later
we’ll implement behavior for this type such that every instance of
<code>AlwaysEqual</code> is always equal to every instance of any other type, perhaps to
have a known result for testing purposes. We wouldn’t need any data to
implement that behavior! You’ll see in Chapter 10 how to define traits and
implement them on any type, including unit-like structs.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="ownership-of-struct-data"><a class="header" href="#ownership-of-struct-data">Ownership of Struct Data</a></h3>
<p>In the <code>User</code> struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned <code>String</code>
type rather than the <code>&amp;str</code> string slice type. This is a deliberate choice
because we want each instance of this struct to own all of its data and for
that data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.</p>
<p>It’s also possible for structs to store references to data owned by something
else, but to do so requires the use of <em>lifetimes</em>, a Rust feature that we’ll
discuss in Chapter 10. Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct
is valid for as long as the struct is. Let’s say you try to store a reference
in a struct without specifying lifetimes, like the following; this won’t work:</p>

<p>To understand when we might want to use structs, let’s write a program that
calculates the area of a rectangle. We’ll start by using single variables, and
then refactor the program until we’re using structs instead.</p>
<p>Let’s make a new binary project with Cargo called <em>rectangles</em> that will take
the width and height of a rectangle specified in pixels and calculate the area
of the rectangle. Listing 5-8 shows a short program with one way of doing
exactly that in our project’s <em>src/main.rs</em>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let width1 = 30;
    let height1 = 50;

    println!(
        &quot;The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.&quot;,
        area(width1, height1)
    );
}

fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -&gt; u32 {
    width * height
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-8: Calculating the area of a rectangle
specified by separate width and height variables</span></p>
<p>Now, run this program using <code>cargo run</code>:</p>

The area of the rectangle is 1500 square pixels.
</code></pre>
<p>This code succeeds in figuring out the area of the rectangle by calling the
<code>area</code> function with each dimension, but we can do more to make this code clear
and readable.</p>
<p>The issue with this code is evident in the signature of <code>area</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {

</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>area</code> function is supposed to calculate the area of one rectangle, but the
function we wrote has two parameters, and it’s not clear anywhere in our
program that the parameters are related. It would be more readable and more
manageable to group width and height together. We’ve already discussed one way
we might do that in <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type">“The Tuple Type”</a><!-- ignore --> section
of Chapter 3: by using tuples.</p>
<h3 id="refactoring-with-tuples"><a class="header" href="#refactoring-with-tuples">Refactoring with Tuples</a></h3>
<p>Listing 5-9 shows another version of our program that uses tuples.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let rect1 = (30, 50);

    println!(

        area(rect1)
    );
}

fn area(dimensions: (u32, u32)) -&gt; u32 {

</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-9: Specifying the width and height of the

<p>In one way, this program is better. Tuples let us add a bit of structure, and
we’re now passing just one argument. But in another way, this version is less
clear: tuples don’t name their elements, so we have to index into the parts of
the tuple, making our calculation less obvious.</p>
<p>Mixing up the width and height wouldn’t matter for the area calculation, but if
we want to draw the rectangle on the screen, it would matter! We would have to
keep in mind that <code>width</code> is the tuple index <code>0</code> and <code>height</code> is the tuple
index <code>1</code>. This would be even harder for someone else to figure out and keep in
mind if they were to use our code. Because we haven’t conveyed the meaning of
our data in our code, it’s now easier to introduce errors.</p>
<h3 id="refactoring-with-structs-adding-more-meaning"><a class="header" href="#refactoring-with-structs-adding-more-meaning">Refactoring with Structs: Adding More Meaning</a></h3>
<p>We use structs to add meaning by labeling the data. We can transform the tuple
we’re using into a struct with a name for the whole as well as names for the
parts, as shown in Listing 5-10.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        &quot;The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.&quot;,
        area(&amp;rect1)
    );
}

fn area(rectangle: &amp;Rectangle) -&gt; u32 {
    rectangle.width * rectangle.height

</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-10: Defining a <code>Rectangle</code> struct</span></p>
<p>Here we’ve defined a struct and named it <code>Rectangle</code>. Inside the curly
brackets, we defined the fields as <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, both of which have
type <code>u32</code>. Then in <code>main</code>, we created a particular instance of <code>Rectangle</code>
that has a width of 30 and a height of 50.</p>
<p>Our <code>area</code> function is now defined with one parameter, which we’ve named
<code>rectangle</code>, whose type is an immutable borrow of a struct <code>Rectangle</code>
instance. As mentioned in Chapter 4, we want to borrow the struct rather than
take ownership of it. This way, <code>main</code> retains its ownership and can continue
using <code>rect1</code>, which is the reason we use the <code>&amp;</code> in the function signature and
where we call the function.</p>
<p>The <code>area</code> function accesses the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> fields of the <code>Rectangle</code>
instance (note that accessing fields of a borrowed struct instance does not
move the field values, which is why you often see borrows of structs). Our
function signature for <code>area</code> now says exactly what we mean: calculate the area
of <code>Rectangle</code>, using its <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> fields. This conveys that the
width and height are related to each other, and it gives descriptive names to
the values rather than using the tuple index values of <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. This is a
win for clarity.</p>
<h3 id="adding-useful-functionality-with-derived-traits"><a class="header" href="#adding-useful-functionality-with-derived-traits">Adding Useful Functionality with Derived Traits</a></h3>
<p>It’d be useful to be able to print an instance of <code>Rectangle</code> while we’re
debugging our program and see the values for all its fields. Listing 5-11 tries
using the <a href="../std/macro.println.html"><code>println!</code> macro</a><!-- ignore --> as we have used in
previous chapters. This won’t work, however.</p>

<p>When we compile this code, we get an error with this core message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0277]: `Rectangle` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>println!</code> macro can do many kinds of formatting, and by default, the curly
brackets tell <code>println!</code> to use formatting known as <code>Display</code>: output intended
for direct end user consumption. The primitive types we’ve seen so far
implement <code>Display</code> by default, because there’s only one way you’d want to show
a <code>1</code> or any other primitive type to a user. But with structs, the way
<code>println!</code> should format the output is less clear because there are more
display possibilities: Do you want commas or not? Do you want to print the
curly brackets? Should all the fields be shown? Due to this ambiguity, Rust
doesn’t try to guess what we want, and structs don’t have a provided
implementation of <code>Display</code> to use with <code>println!</code> and the <code>{}</code> placeholder.</p>
<p>If we continue reading the errors, we’ll find this helpful note:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">   = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `Rectangle`
   = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s try it! The <code>println!</code> macro call will now look like <code>println!(&quot;rect1 is {:?}&quot;, rect1);</code>. Putting the specifier <code>:?</code> inside the curly brackets tells
<code>println!</code> we want to use an output format called <code>Debug</code>. The <code>Debug</code> trait
enables us to print our struct in a way that is useful for developers so we can
see its value while we’re debugging our code.</p>
<p>Compile the code with this change. Drat! We still get an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0277]: `Rectangle` doesn't implement `Debug`
</code></pre>
<p>But again, the compiler gives us a helpful note:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">   = help: the trait `Debug` is not implemented for `Rectangle`
   = note: add `#[derive(Debug)]` to `Rectangle` or manually `impl Debug for Rectangle`
</code></pre>
<p>Rust <em>does</em> include functionality to print out debugging information, but we
have to explicitly opt in to make that functionality available for our struct.
To do that, we add the outer attribute <code>#[derive(Debug)]</code> just before the
struct definition, as shown in Listing 5-12.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,

    println!(&quot;rect1 is {:?}&quot;, rect1);
}

<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-12: Adding the attribute to derive the <code>Debug</code>

<p>Now when we run the program, we won’t get any errors, and we’ll see the
following output:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Nice! It’s not the prettiest output, but it shows the values of all the fields
for this instance, which would definitely help during debugging. When we have
larger structs, it’s useful to have output that’s a bit easier to read; in
those cases, we can use <code>{:#?}</code> instead of <code>{:?}</code> in the <code>println!</code> string.
In this example, using the <code>{:#?}</code> style will output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
     Running `target/debug/rectangles`
rect1 is Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
}
</code></pre>
<p>Another way to print out a value using the <code>Debug</code> format is to use the <a href="../std/macro.dbg.html"><code>dbg!</code>
macro</a><!-- ignore -->, which takes ownership of an expression (as opposed
to <code>println!</code> that takes a reference), prints the file and line number of where
that <code>dbg!</code> macro call occurs in your code along with the resulting value of
that expression, and returns ownership of the value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Calling the <code>dbg!</code> macro prints to the standard error console stream
(<code>stderr</code>), as opposed to <code>println!</code> which prints to the standard output
console stream (<code>stdout</code>). We’ll talk more about <code>stderr</code> and <code>stdout</code> in the
“<a href="ch12-06-writing-to-stderr-instead-of-stdout.html">“Writing Error Messages to Standard Error Instead of Standard
Output” section in Chapter 12</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s an example where we’re interested in the value that gets assigned to the
<code>width</code> field, as well as the value of the whole struct in <code>rect1</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let scale = 2;
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: dbg!(30 * scale),
        height: 50,
    };

    dbg!(&amp;rect1);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>We can put <code>dbg!</code> around the expression <code>30 * scale</code> and, because <code>dbg!</code>
returns ownership of the expression’s value, the <code>width</code> field will get the
same value as if we didn’t have the <code>dbg!</code> call there. We don’t want <code>dbg!</code> to
take ownership of <code>rect1</code>, so we use a reference to <code>rect1</code> in the next call.
Here’s what the output of this example looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.61s
     Running `target/debug/rectangles`
[src/main.rs:10] 30 * scale = 60
[src/main.rs:14] &amp;rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 60,
    height: 50,
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can see the first bit of output came from <em>src/main.rs</em> line 10, where we’re
debugging the expression <code>30 * scale</code>, and its resulting value is 60 (the
<code>Debug</code> formatting implemented for integers is to print only their value). The
<code>dbg!</code> call on line 14 of <em>src/main.rs</em> outputs the value of <code>&amp;rect1</code>, which is
the <code>Rectangle</code> struct. This output uses the pretty <code>Debug</code> formatting of the
<code>Rectangle</code> type. The <code>dbg!</code> macro can be really helpful when you’re trying to
figure out what your code is doing!</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>Debug</code> trait, Rust has provided a number of traits for us
to use with the <code>derive</code> attribute that can add useful behavior to our custom
types. Those traits and their behaviors are listed in <a href="appendix-03-derivable-traits.html">Appendix C</a><!--
ignore -->. We’ll cover how to implement these traits with custom behavior as
well as how to create your own traits in Chapter 10. There are also many
attributes other than <code>derive</code>; for more information, see <a href="../reference/attributes.html">the “Attributes”
section of the Rust Reference</a>.</p>
<p>Our <code>area</code> function is very specific: it only computes the area of rectangles.
It would be helpful to tie this behavior more closely to our <code>Rectangle</code>
struct, because it won’t work with any other type. Let’s look at how we can
continue to refactor this code by turning the <code>area</code> function into an <code>area</code>
<em>method</em> defined on our <code>Rectangle</code> type.</p>

<p><em>Methods</em> are similar to functions: we declare them with the <code>fn</code> keyword and a
name, they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some code
that’s run when the method is called from somewhere else. Unlike functions,
methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait
object, which we cover in Chapters 6 and 17, respectively), and their first

<code>Rectangle</code> struct</span></p>
<p>To define the function within the context of <code>Rectangle</code>, we start an <code>impl</code>
(implementation) block for <code>Rectangle</code>. Everything within this <code>impl</code> block
will be associated with the <code>Rectangle</code> type. Then we move the <code>area</code> function
within the <code>impl</code> curly brackets and change the first (and in this case, only)
parameter to be <code>self</code> in the signature and everywhere within the body. In
<code>main</code>, where we called the <code>area</code> function and passed <code>rect1</code> as an argument,
we can instead use <em>method syntax</em> to call the <code>area</code> method on our <code>Rectangle</code>
instance. The method syntax goes after an instance: we add a dot followed by
the method name, parentheses, and any arguments.</p>
<p>In the signature for <code>area</code>, we use <code>&amp;self</code> instead of <code>rectangle: &amp;Rectangle</code>.
The <code>&amp;self</code> is actually short for <code>self: &amp;Self</code>. Within an <code>impl</code> block, the
type <code>Self</code> is an alias for the type that the <code>impl</code> block is for. Methods must
have a parameter named <code>self</code> of type <code>Self</code> for their first parameter, so Rust
lets you abbreviate this with only the name <code>self</code> in the first parameter spot.
Note that we still need to use the <code>&amp;</code> in front of the <code>self</code> shorthand to
indicate this method borrows the <code>Self</code> instance, just as we did in <code>rectangle: &amp;Rectangle</code>. Methods can take ownership of <code>self</code>, borrow <code>self</code> immutably as
we’ve done here, or borrow <code>self</code> mutably, just as they can any other parameter.</p>
<p>We’ve chosen <code>&amp;self</code> here for the same reason we used <code>&amp;Rectangle</code> in the
function version: we don’t want to take ownership, and we just want to read the
data in the struct, not write to it. If we wanted to change the instance that
we’ve called the method on as part of what the method does, we’d use <code>&amp;mut self</code> as the first parameter. Having a method that takes ownership of the
instance by using just <code>self</code> as the first parameter is rare; this technique is
usually used when the method transforms <code>self</code> into something else and you want
to prevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation.</p>
<p>The main reason for using methods instead of functions, in addition to providing
method syntax and not having to repeat the type of <code>self</code> in every method’s
signature, is for organization. We’ve put all the things we can do with an
instance of a type in one <code>impl</code> block rather than making future users of our
code search for capabilities of <code>Rectangle</code> in various places in the library we
provide.</p>
<p>Note that we can choose to give a method the same name as one of the struct’s
fields. For example, we can define a method on <code>Rectangle</code> also named <code>width</code>:</p>

    if rect1.width() {
        println!(&quot;The rectangle has a nonzero width; it is {}&quot;, rect1.width);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, we’re choosing to make the <code>width</code> method return <code>true</code> if the value in
the instance’s <code>width</code> field is greater than 0, and <code>false</code> if the value is 0:
we can use a field within a method of the same name for any purpose. In <code>main</code>,
when we follow <code>rect1.width</code> with parentheses, Rust knows we mean the method
<code>width</code>. When we don’t use parentheses, Rust knows we mean the field <code>width</code>.</p>
<p>Often, but not always, when we give methods with the same name as a field we
want it to only return the value in the field and do nothing else. Methods like
this are called <em>getters</em>, and Rust does not implement them automatically for
struct fields as some other languages do. Getters are useful because you can
make the field private but the method public and thus enable read-only access
to that field as part of the type’s public API. We will be discussing what
public and private are and how to designate a field or method as public or
private in Chapter 7.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="wheres-the---operator"><a class="header" href="#wheres-the---operator">Where’s the <code>-&gt;</code> Operator?</a></h3>
<p>In C and C++, two different operators are used for calling methods: you use
<code>.</code> if you’re calling a method on the object directly and <code>-&gt;</code> if you’re
calling the method on a pointer to the object and need to dereference the
pointer first. In other words, if <code>object</code> is a pointer,
<code>object-&gt;something()</code> is similar to <code>(*object).something()</code>.</p>
<p>Rust doesn’t have an equivalent to the <code>-&gt;</code> operator; instead, Rust has a
feature called <em>automatic referencing and dereferencing</em>. Calling methods is
one of the few places in Rust that has this behavior.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: when you call a method with <code>object.something()</code>, Rust
automatically adds in <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&amp;mut</code>, or <code>*</code> so <code>object</code> matches the signature of
the method. In other words, the following are the same:</p>

<p>The first one looks much cleaner. This automatic referencing behavior works
because methods have a clear receiver—the type of <code>self</code>. Given the receiver
and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is
reading (<code>&amp;self</code>), mutating (<code>&amp;mut self</code>), or consuming (<code>self</code>). The fact
that Rust makes borrowing implicit for method receivers is a big part of
making ownership ergonomic in practice.</p>

<p>Let’s practice using methods by implementing a second method on the <code>Rectangle</code>
struct. This time, we want an instance of <code>Rectangle</code> to take another instance
of <code>Rectangle</code> and return <code>true</code> if the second <code>Rectangle</code> can fit completely
within <code>self</code> (the first <code>Rectangle</code>); otherwise it should return <code>false</code>. That
is, once we’ve defined the <code>can_hold</code> method, we want to be able to write the
program shown in Listing 5-14.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-14: Using the as-yet-unwritten <code>can_hold</code>

<pre><code class="language-text">Can rect1 hold rect2? true

<p>We know we want to define a method, so it will be within the <code>impl Rectangle</code>
block. The method name will be <code>can_hold</code>, and it will take an immutable borrow
of another <code>Rectangle</code> as a parameter. We can tell what the type of the
parameter will be by looking at the code that calls the method:
<code>rect1.can_hold(&amp;rect2)</code> passes in <code>&amp;rect2</code>, which is an immutable borrow to
<code>rect2</code>, an instance of <code>Rectangle</code>. This makes sense because we only need to
read <code>rect2</code> (rather than write, which would mean we’d need a mutable borrow),
and we want <code>main</code> to retain ownership of <code>rect2</code> so we can use it again after
calling the <code>can_hold</code> method. The return value of <code>can_hold</code> will be a
Boolean, and the implementation will check whether the width and height of
<code>self</code> are both greater than the width and height of the other <code>Rectangle</code>,
respectively. Let’s add the new <code>can_hold</code> method to the <code>impl</code> block from
Listing 5-13, shown in Listing 5-15.</p>

<p>When we run this code with the <code>main</code> function in Listing 5-14, we’ll get our

signature after the <code>self</code> parameter, and those parameters work just like
parameters in functions.</p>
<h3 id="associated-functions"><a class="header" href="#associated-functions">Associated Functions</a></h3>
<p>All functions defined within an <code>impl</code> block are called <em>associated functions</em>
because they’re associated with the type named after the <code>impl</code>. We can define
associated functions that don’t have <code>self</code> as their first parameter (and thus
are not methods) because they don’t need an instance of the type to work with.
We’ve already used one function like this: the <code>String::from</code> function that’s
defined on the <code>String</code> type.</p>
<p>Associated functions that aren’t methods are often used for constructors that
will return a new instance of the struct. These are often called <code>new</code>, but
<code>new</code> isn’t a special name and isn’t built into the language. For example, we
could choose to provide an associated function named <code>square</code> that would have
one dimension parameter and use that as both width and height, thus making it
easier to create a square <code>Rectangle</code> rather than having to specify the same
value twice:</p>

<p>The <code>Self</code> keywords in the return type and in the body of the function are
aliases for the type that appears after the <code>impl</code> keyword, which in this case
is <code>Rectangle</code>.</p>
<p>To call this associated function, we use the <code>::</code> syntax with the struct name;
<code>let sq = Rectangle::square(3);</code> is an example. This function is namespaced by
the struct: the <code>::</code> syntax is used for both associated functions and
namespaces created by modules. We’ll discuss modules in Chapter 7.</p>

<p>Structs let you create custom types that are meaningful for your domain. By
using structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other

functions that are associated with your type, and methods are a kind of
associated function that let you specify the behavior that instances of your

<p>In this chapter we’ll look at <em>enumerations</em>, also referred to as <em>enums</em>.
Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible <em>variants</em>. First,
we’ll define and use an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along with
data. Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful enum, called <code>Option</code>, which
expresses that a value can be either something or nothing. Then we’ll look at
how pattern matching in the <code>match</code> expression makes it easy to run different
code for different values of an enum. Finally, we’ll cover how the <code>if let</code>
construct is another convenient and concise idiom available to handle enums in
your code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="defining-an-enum"><a class="header" href="#defining-an-enum">Defining an Enum</a></h2>
<p>Where structs give you a way of grouping together related fields and data, like
a <code>Rectangle</code> with its <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, enums give you a way of saying a
value is one of a possible set of values. For example, we may want to say that
<code>Rectangle</code> is one of a set of possible shapes that also includes <code>Circle</code> and
<code>Triangle</code>. To do this, Rust allows us to encode these possibilities as an enum.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a situation we might want to express in code and see why enums
are useful and more appropriate than structs in this case. Say we need to work
with IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses:
version four and version six. Because these are the only possibilities for an
IP address that our program will come across, we can <em>enumerate</em> all possible
variants, which is where enumeration gets its name.</p>
<p>Any IP address can be either a version four or a version six address, but not
both at the same time. That property of IP addresses makes the enum data
structure appropriate, because an enum value can only be one of its variants.
Both version four and version six addresses are still fundamentally IP
addresses, so they should be treated as the same type when the code is handling
situations that apply to any kind of IP address.</p>
<p>We can express this concept in code by defining an <code>IpAddrKind</code> enumeration and
listing the possible kinds an IP address can be, <code>V4</code> and <code>V6</code>. These are the
variants of the enum:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
</span><span class="boring">    let six = IpAddrKind::V6;

</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><code>IpAddrKind</code> is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.</p>
<h3 id="enum-values"><a class="header" href="#enum-values">Enum Values</a></h3>
<p>We can create instances of each of the two variants of <code>IpAddrKind</code> like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">enum IpAddrKind {
</span><span class="boring">    V4,
</span><span class="boring">    V6,

</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that the variants of the enum are namespaced under its identifier, and we
use a double colon to separate the two. This is useful because now both values
<code>IpAddrKind::V4</code> and <code>IpAddrKind::V6</code> are of the same type: <code>IpAddrKind</code>. We
can then, for instance, define a function that takes any <code>IpAddrKind</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">enum IpAddrKind {
</span><span class="boring">    V4,
</span><span class="boring">    V6,

</span><span class="boring">    let six = IpAddrKind::V6;

</span><span class="boring">    route(IpAddrKind::V4);
</span><span class="boring">    route(IpAddrKind::V6);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span>fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}

<p>And we can call this function with either variant:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">enum IpAddrKind {
</span><span class="boring">    V4,
</span><span class="boring">    V6,

<span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Using enums has even more advantages. Thinking more about our IP address type,
at the moment we don’t have a way to store the actual IP address <em>data</em>; we
only know what <em>kind</em> it is. Given that you just learned about structs in
Chapter 5, you might be tempted to tackle this problem with structs as shown in
Listing 6-1.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    enum IpAddrKind {
        V4,
        V6,
    }

    struct IpAddr {
        kind: IpAddrKind,
        address: String,
    }

    let home = IpAddr {
        kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
        address: String::from(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;),
    };

    let loopback = IpAddr {
        kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
        address: String::from(&quot;::1&quot;),
    };
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-1: Storing the data and <code>IpAddrKind</code> variant of
an IP address using a <code>struct</code></span></p>
<p>Here, we’ve defined a struct <code>IpAddr</code> that has two fields: a <code>kind</code> field that
is of type <code>IpAddrKind</code> (the enum we defined previously) and an <code>address</code> field
of type <code>String</code>. We have two instances of this struct. The first is <code>home</code>,
and it has the value <code>IpAddrKind::V4</code> as its <code>kind</code> with associated address
data of <code>127.0.0.1</code>. The second instance is <code>loopback</code>. It has the other
variant of <code>IpAddrKind</code> as its <code>kind</code> value, <code>V6</code>, and has address <code>::1</code>
associated with it. We’ve used a struct to bundle the <code>kind</code> and <code>address</code>
values together, so now the variant is associated with the value.</p>
<p>However, representing the same concept using just an enum is more concise:
rather than an enum inside a struct, we can put data directly into each enum
variant. This new definition of the <code>IpAddr</code> enum says that both <code>V4</code> and <code>V6</code>
variants will have associated <code>String</code> values:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    enum IpAddr {
        V4(String),
        V6(String),
    }

    let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;));

    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from(&quot;::1&quot;));
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We attach data to each variant of the enum directly, so there is no need for an
extra struct. Here it’s also easier to see another detail of how enums work:
the name of each enum variant that we define also becomes a function that
constructs an instance of the enum. That is, <code>IpAddr::V4()</code> is a function call
that takes a <code>String</code> argument and returns an instance of the <code>IpAddr</code> type. We
automatically get this constructor function defined as a result of defining the
enum.</p>
<p>There’s another advantage to using an enum rather than a struct: each variant
can have different types and amounts of associated data. Version four type IP
addresses will always have four numeric components that will have values
between 0 and 255. If we wanted to store <code>V4</code> addresses as four <code>u8</code> values but
still express <code>V6</code> addresses as one <code>String</code> value, we wouldn’t be able to with
a struct. Enums handle this case with ease:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    enum IpAddr {
        V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
        V6(String),
    }

    let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);

    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from(&quot;::1&quot;));
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We’ve shown several different ways to define data structures to store version
four and version six IP addresses. However, as it turns out, wanting to store
IP addresses and encode which kind they are is so common that <a href="../std/net/enum.IpAddr.html">the standard
library has a definition we can use!</a><!-- ignore --> Let’s look at how
the standard library defines <code>IpAddr</code>: it has the exact enum and variants that
we’ve defined and used, but it embeds the address data inside the variants in
the form of two different structs, which are defined differently for each
variant:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct Ipv4Addr {
    // --snip--
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
    // --snip--
}

enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Addr),
    V6(Ipv6Addr),
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This code illustrates that you can put any kind of data inside an enum variant:
strings, numeric types, or structs, for example. You can even include another
enum! Also, standard library types are often not much more complicated than
what you might come up with.</p>
<p>Note that even though the standard library contains a definition for <code>IpAddr</code>,
we can still create and use our own definition without conflict because we
haven’t brought the standard library’s definition into our scope. We’ll talk
more about bringing types into scope in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another example of an enum in Listing 6-2: this one has a wide
variety of types embedded in its variants.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-2: A <code>Message</code> enum whose variants each store
different amounts and types of values</span></p>
<p>This enum has four variants with different types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Quit</code> has no data associated with it at all.</li>
<li><code>Move</code> has named fields like a struct does.</li>
<li><code>Write</code> includes a single <code>String</code>.</li>
<li><code>ChangeColor</code> includes three <code>i32</code> values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining an enum with variants such as the ones in Listing 6-2 is similar to
defining different kinds of struct definitions, except the enum doesn’t use the
<code>struct</code> keyword and all the variants are grouped together under the <code>Message</code>
type. The following structs could hold the same data that the preceding enum
variants hold:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But if we used the different structs, which each have their own type, we
couldn’t as easily define a function to take any of these kinds of messages as
we could with the <code>Message</code> enum defined in Listing 6-2, which is a single type.</p>
<p>There is one more similarity between enums and structs: just as we’re able to
define methods on structs using <code>impl</code>, we’re also able to define methods on
enums. Here’s a method named <code>call</code> that we could define on our <code>Message</code> enum:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    enum Message {
</span><span class="boring">        Quit,
</span><span class="boring">        Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
</span><span class="boring">        Write(String),
</span><span class="boring">        ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
</span><span class="boring">    }
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    impl Message {
        fn call(&amp;self) {
            // method body would be defined here
        }
    }

    let m = Message::Write(String::from(&quot;hello&quot;));
    m.call();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The body of the method would use <code>self</code> to get the value that we called the
method on. In this example, we’ve created a variable <code>m</code> that has the value
<code>Message::Write(String::from(&quot;hello&quot;))</code>, and that is what <code>self</code> will be in the
body of the <code>call</code> method when <code>m.call()</code> runs.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another enum in the standard library that is very common and
useful: <code>Option</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-option-enum-and-its-advantages-over-null-values"><a class="header" href="#the-option-enum-and-its-advantages-over-null-values">The <code>Option</code> Enum and Its Advantages Over Null Values</a></h3>
<p>This section explores a case study of <code>Option</code>, which is another enum defined
by the standard library. The <code>Option</code> type encodes the very common scenario in
which a value could be something or it could be nothing.</p>
<p>For example, if you request the first of a list containing items, you would get
a value. If you request the first item of an empty list, you would get nothing.
Expressing this concept in terms of the type system means the compiler can
check whether you’ve handled all the cases you should be handling; this
functionality can prevent bugs that are extremely common in other programming
languages.</p>
<p>Programming language design is often thought of in terms of which features you
include, but the features you exclude are important too. Rust doesn’t have the
null feature that many other languages have. <em>Null</em> is a value that means there
is no value there. In languages with null, variables can always be in one of
two states: null or not-null.</p>
<p>In his 2009 presentation “Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,” Tony
Hoare, the inventor of null, has this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time, I was designing the first
comprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented language. My
goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with
checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn’t resist the
temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to
implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system
crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in
the last forty years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with null values is that if you try to use a null value as a
not-null value, you’ll get an error of some kind. Because this null or not-null
property is pervasive, it’s extremely easy to make this kind of error.</p>
<p>However, the concept that null is trying to express is still a useful one: a
null is a value that is currently invalid or absent for some reason.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t really with the concept but with the particular
implementation. As such, Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum
that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, and it is <a href="../std/option/enum.Option.html">defined by the standard library</a><!-- ignore -->
as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Option&lt;T&gt; {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum is so useful that it’s even included in the prelude; you
don’t need to bring it into scope explicitly. Its variants are also included in
the prelude: you can use <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code> directly without the <code>Option::</code>
prefix. The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum is still just a regular enum, and <code>Some(T)</code> and
<code>None</code> are still variants of type <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> syntax is a feature of Rust we haven’t talked about yet. It’s a
generic type parameter, and we’ll cover generics in more detail in Chapter 10.
For now, all you need to know is that <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> means the <code>Some</code> variant of the
<code>Option</code> enum can hold one piece of data of any type, and that each concrete
type that gets used in place of <code>T</code> makes the overall <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> type a
different type. Here are some examples of using <code>Option</code> values to hold number
types and string types:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let some_number = Some(5);
    let some_char = Some('e');

    let absent_number: Option&lt;i32&gt; = None;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The type of <code>some_number</code> is <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code>. The type of <code>some_char</code> is
<code>Option&lt;char&gt;</code>, which is a different type. Rust can infer these types because
we’ve specified a value inside the <code>Some</code> variant. For <code>absent_number</code>, Rust
requires us to annotate the overall <code>Option</code> type: the compiler can’t infer the
type that the corresponding <code>Some</code> variant will hold by looking only at a
<code>None</code> value. Here, we tell Rust that we mean for <code>absent_number</code> to be of type
<code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>When we have a <code>Some</code> value, we know that a value is present and the value is
held within the <code>Some</code>. When we have a <code>None</code> value, in some sense, it means
the same thing as null: we don’t have a valid value. So why is having
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> any better than having null?</p>
<p>In short, because <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>T</code> (where <code>T</code> can be any type) are different
types, the compiler won’t let us use an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> value as if it were
definitely a valid value. For example, this code won’t compile because it’s
trying to add an <code>i8</code> to an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let x: i8 = 5;
    let y: Option&lt;i8&gt; = Some(5);

    let sum = x + y;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we run this code, we get an error message like this:</p>

error: could not compile `enums` due to previous error
</code></pre>
<p>Intense! In effect, this error message means that Rust doesn’t understand how
to add an <code>i8</code> and an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code>, because they’re different types. When we
have a value of a type like <code>i8</code> in Rust, the compiler will ensure that we
always have a valid value. We can proceed confidently without having to check
for null before using that value. Only when we have an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code> (or
whatever type of value we’re working with) do we have to worry about possibly
not having a value, and the compiler will make sure we handle that case before
using the value.</p>
<p>In other words, you have to convert an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> to a <code>T</code> before you can
perform <code>T</code> operations with it. Generally, this helps catch one of the most
common issues with null: assuming that something isn’t null when it actually
is.</p>
<p>Eliminating the risk of incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps you to be
more confident in your code. In order to have a value that can possibly be
null, you must explicitly opt in by making the type of that value <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>.
Then, when you use that value, you are required to explicitly handle the case
when the value is null. Everywhere that a value has a type that isn’t an
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, you <em>can</em> safely assume that the value isn’t null. This was a
deliberate design decision for Rust to limit null’s pervasiveness and increase
the safety of Rust code.</p>
<p>So, how do you get the <code>T</code> value out of a <code>Some</code> variant when you have a value
of type <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> so you can use that value? The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum has a large
number of methods that are useful in a variety of situations; you can check
them out in <a href="../std/option/enum.Option.html">its documentation</a><!-- ignore -->. Becoming familiar with
the methods on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> will be extremely useful in your journey with Rust.</p>
<p>In general, in order to use an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> value, you want to have code that
will handle each variant. You want some code that will run only when you have a
<code>Some(T)</code> value, and this code is allowed to use the inner <code>T</code>. You want some
other code to run if you have a <code>None</code> value, and that code doesn’t have a <code>T</code>
value available. The <code>match</code> expression is a control flow construct that does
just this when used with enums: it will run different code depending on which
variant of the enum it has, and that code can use the data inside the matching
value.</p>

<h2 id="the-match-control-flow-construct"><a class="header" href="#the-match-control-flow-construct">The <code>match</code> Control Flow Construct</a></h2>
<p>Rust has an extremely powerful control flow construct called <code>match</code> that allows
you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based
on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable
names, wildcards, and many other things; Chapter 18 covers all the different
kinds of patterns and what they do. The power of <code>match</code> comes from the
expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler confirms that all
possible cases are handled.</p>
<p>Think of a <code>match</code> expression as being like a coin-sorting machine: coins slide
down a track with variously sized holes along it, and each coin falls through
the first hole it encounters that it fits into. In the same way, values go
through each pattern in a <code>match</code>, and at the first pattern the value “fits,”
the value falls into the associated code block to be used during execution.</p>
<p>Speaking of coins, let’s use them as an example using <code>match</code>! We can write a
function that takes an unknown United States coin and, in a similar way as the
counting machine, determines which coin it is and return its value in cents, as
shown here in Listing 6-3.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -&gt; u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny =&gt; 1,
        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,
        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,
        Coin::Quarter =&gt; 25,
    }
}
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-3: An enum and a <code>match</code> expression that has
the variants of the enum as its patterns</span></p>
<p>Let’s break down the <code>match</code> in the <code>value_in_cents</code> function. First, we list
the <code>match</code> keyword followed by an expression, which in this case is the value
<code>coin</code>. This seems very similar to an expression used with <code>if</code>, but there’s a
big difference: with <code>if</code>, the expression needs to return a Boolean value, but
here, it can return any type. The type of <code>coin</code> in this example is the <code>Coin</code>
enum that we defined on the first line.</p>
<p>Next are the <code>match</code> arms. An arm has two parts: a pattern and some code. The
first arm here has a pattern that is the value <code>Coin::Penny</code> and then the <code>=&gt;</code>
operator that separates the pattern and the code to run. The code in this case
is just the value <code>1</code>. Each arm is separated from the next with a comma.</p>
<p>When the <code>match</code> expression executes, it compares the resulting value against
the pattern of each arm, in order. If a pattern matches the value, the code
associated with that pattern is executed. If that pattern doesn’t match the
value, execution continues to the next arm, much as in a coin-sorting machine.
We can have as many arms as we need: in Listing 6-3, our <code>match</code> has four arms.</p>
<p>The code associated with each arm is an expression, and the resulting value of
the expression in the matching arm is the value that gets returned for the
entire <code>match</code> expression.</p>
<p>We don’t typically use curly brackets if the match arm code is short, as it is
in Listing 6-3 where each arm just returns a value. If you want to run multiple
lines of code in a match arm, you must use curly brackets, and the comma
following the arm is then optional. For example, the following code prints
“Lucky penny!” every time the method is called with a <code>Coin::Penny</code>, but still
returns the last value of the block, <code>1</code>:</p>

            1
        }
        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,
        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,
        Coin::Quarter =&gt; 25,
    }

<h3 id="patterns-that-bind-to-values"><a class="header" href="#patterns-that-bind-to-values">Patterns that Bind to Values</a></h3>
<p>Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the
values that match the pattern. This is how we can extract values out of enum
variants.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s change one of our enum variants to hold data inside it.
From 1999 through 2008, the United States minted quarters with different
designs for each of the 50 states on one side. No other coins got state
designs, so only quarters have this extra value. We can add this information to
our <code>enum</code> by changing the <code>Quarter</code> variant to include a <code>UsState</code> value stored
inside it, which we’ve done here in Listing 6-4.</p>

<p>In the match expression for this code, we add a variable called <code>state</code> to the

that point, the binding for <code>state</code> will be the value <code>UsState::Alaska</code>. We can
then use that binding in the <code>println!</code> expression, thus getting the inner

<p>In the previous section, we wanted to get the inner <code>T</code> value out of the <code>Some</code>
case when using <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>; we can also handle <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> using <code>match</code> as we
did with the <code>Coin</code> enum! Instead of comparing coins, we’ll compare the
variants of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, but the way that the <code>match</code> expression works remains
the same.</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to write a function that takes an <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> and, if
there’s a value inside, adds 1 to that value. If there isn’t a value inside,
the function should return the <code>None</code> value and not attempt to perform any
operations.</p>
<p>This function is very easy to write, thanks to <code>match</code>, and will look like
Listing 6-5.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {

            None =&gt; None,
            Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),
        }
    }

    let five = Some(5);
    let six = plus_one(five);

<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-5: A function that uses a <code>match</code> expression on

<p>Let’s examine the first execution of <code>plus_one</code> in more detail. When we call
<code>plus_one(five)</code>, the variable <code>x</code> in the body of <code>plus_one</code> will have the
value <code>Some(5)</code>. We then compare that against each match arm.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {

</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>Some(5)</code> value doesn’t match the pattern <code>None</code>, so we continue to the
next arm.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {

</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Does <code>Some(5)</code> match <code>Some(i)</code>? Why yes it does! We have the same variant. The
<code>i</code> binds to the value contained in <code>Some</code>, so <code>i</code> takes the value <code>5</code>. The
code in the match arm is then executed, so we add 1 to the value of <code>i</code> and
create a new <code>Some</code> value with our total <code>6</code> inside.</p>
<p>Now let’s consider the second call of <code>plus_one</code> in Listing 6-5, where <code>x</code> is
<code>None</code>. We enter the <code>match</code> and compare to the first arm.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {

</span><span class="boring">    let six = plus_one(five);
</span><span class="boring">    let none = plus_one(None);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>It matches! There’s no value to add to, so the program stops and returns the
<code>None</code> value on the right side of <code>=&gt;</code>. Because the first arm matched, no other
arms are compared.</p>
<p>Combining <code>match</code> and enums is useful in many situations. You’ll see this
pattern a lot in Rust code: <code>match</code> against an enum, bind a variable to the
data inside, and then execute code based on it. It’s a bit tricky at first, but
once you get used to it, you’ll wish you had it in all languages. It’s
consistently a user favorite.</p>
<h3 id="matches-are-exhaustive"><a class="header" href="#matches-are-exhaustive">Matches Are Exhaustive</a></h3>
<p>There’s one other aspect of <code>match</code> we need to discuss: the arms’ patterns must
cover all possibilities. Consider this version of our <code>plus_one</code> function,
which has a bug and won’t compile:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {

</span></code></pre>
<p>We didn’t handle the <code>None</code> case, so this code will cause a bug. Luckily, it’s
a bug Rust knows how to catch. If we try to compile this code, we’ll get this
error:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Rust knows that we didn’t cover every possible case and even knows which
pattern we forgot! Matches in Rust are <em>exhaustive</em>: we must exhaust every last
possibility in order for the code to be valid. Especially in the case of
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, when Rust prevents us from forgetting to explicitly handle the
<code>None</code> case, it protects us from assuming that we have a value when we might
have null, thus making the billion-dollar mistake discussed earlier impossible.</p>
<h3 id="catch-all-patterns-and-the-_-placeholder"><a class="header" href="#catch-all-patterns-and-the-_-placeholder">Catch-all Patterns and the <code>_</code> Placeholder</a></h3>
<p>Using enums, we can also take special actions for a few particular values, but
for all other values take one default action. Imagine we’re implementing a game
where, if you roll a 3 on a dice roll, your player doesn’t move, but instead
gets a new fancy hat. If you roll a 7, your player loses a fancy hat. For all
other values, your player moves that number of spaces on the game board. Here’s
a <code>match</code> that implements that logic, with the result of the dice roll
hardcoded rather than a random value, and all other logic represented by
functions without bodies because actually implementing them is out of scope for
this example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 =&gt; add_fancy_hat(),
        7 =&gt; remove_fancy_hat(),
        other =&gt; move_player(other),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>For the first two arms, the patterns are the literal values 3 and 7. For the
last arm that covers every other possible value, the pattern is the variable
we’ve chosen to name <code>other</code>. The code that runs for the <code>other</code> arm uses the
variable by passing it to the <code>move_player</code> function.</p>
<p>This code compiles, even though we haven’t listed all the possible values a
<code>u8</code> can have, because the last pattern will match all values not specifically
listed. This catch-all pattern meets the requirement that <code>match</code> must be
exhaustive. Note that we have to put the catch-all arm last because the
patterns are evaluated in order. If we put the catch-all arm earlier, the other
arms would never run, so Rust will warn us if we add arms after a catch-all!</p>
<p>Rust also has a pattern we can use when we want a catch-all but don’t want to
<em>use</em> the value in the catch-all pattern: <code>_</code> is a special pattern that matches
any value and does not bind to that value. This tells Rust we aren’t going to
use the value, so Rust won’t warn us about an unused variable.</p>
<p>Let’s change the rules of the game: now, if you roll anything other than a 3 or
a 7, you must roll again. We no longer need to use the catch-all value, so we
can change our code to use <code>_</code> instead of the variable named <code>other</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 =&gt; add_fancy_hat(),
        7 =&gt; remove_fancy_hat(),
        _ =&gt; reroll(),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn reroll() {}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This example also meets the exhaustiveness requirement because we’re explicitly
ignoring all other values in the last arm; we haven’t forgotten anything.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll change the rules of the game one more time, so that nothing else
happens on your turn if you roll anything other than a 3 or a 7. We can express
that by using the unit value (the empty tuple type we mentioned in <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type">“The Tuple
Type”</a><!-- ignore --> section) as the code that goes with the <code>_</code> arm:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 =&gt; add_fancy_hat(),
        7 =&gt; remove_fancy_hat(),
        _ =&gt; (),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, we’re telling Rust explicitly that we aren’t going to use any other value
that doesn’t match a pattern in an earlier arm, and we don’t want to run any
code in this case.</p>
<p>There’s more about patterns and matching that we’ll cover in <a href="ch18-00-patterns.html">Chapter
18</a><!-- ignore -->. For now, we’re going to move on to the
<code>if let</code> syntax, which can be useful in situations where the <code>match</code> expression
is a bit wordy.</p>

<p>The <code>if let</code> syntax lets you combine <code>if</code> and <code>let</code> into a less verbose way to
handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. Consider the
program in Listing 6-6 that matches on an <code>Option&lt;u8&gt;</code> value in the <code>config_max</code>
variable but only wants to execute code if the value is the <code>Some</code> variant.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    match config_max {
        Some(max) =&gt; println!(&quot;The maximum is configured to be {}&quot;, max),
        _ =&gt; (),
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 6-6: A <code>match</code> that only cares about executing
code when the value is <code>Some</code></span></p>
<p>If the value is <code>Some</code>, we print out the value in the <code>Some</code> variant by binding
the value to the variable <code>max</code> in the pattern. We don’t want to do anything
with the <code>None</code> value. To satisfy the <code>match</code> expression, we have to add <code>_ =&gt; ()</code> after processing just one variant, which is annoying boilerplate code to
add.</p>
<p>Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using <code>if let</code>. The following
code behaves the same as the <code>match</code> in Listing 6-6:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    if let Some(max) = config_max {
        println!(&quot;The maximum is configured to be {}&quot;, max);
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The syntax <code>if let</code> takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal
sign. It works the same way as a <code>match</code>, where the expression is given to the
<code>match</code> and the pattern is its first arm. In this case, the pattern is
<code>Some(max)</code>, and the <code>max</code> binds to the value inside the <code>Some</code>. We can then
use <code>max</code> in the body of the <code>if let</code> block in the same way as we used <code>max</code> in
the corresponding <code>match</code> arm. The code in the <code>if let</code> block isn’t run if the
value doesn’t match the pattern.</p>
<p>Using <code>if let</code> means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code.
However, you lose the exhaustive checking that <code>match</code> enforces. Choosing
between <code>match</code> and <code>if let</code> depends on what you’re doing in your particular
situation and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for
losing exhaustive checking.</p>
<p>In other words, you can think of <code>if let</code> as syntax sugar for a <code>match</code> that
runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.</p>
<p>We can include an <code>else</code> with an <code>if let</code>. The block of code that goes with the
<code>else</code> is the same as the block of code that would go with the <code>_</code> case in the
<code>match</code> expression that is equivalent to the <code>if let</code> and <code>else</code>. Recall the
<code>Coin</code> enum definition in Listing 6-4, where the <code>Quarter</code> variant also held a
<code>UsState</code> value. If we wanted to count all non-quarter coins we see while also
announcing the state of the quarters, we could do that with a <code>match</code>
expression like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#[derive(Debug)]
</span><span class="boring">enum UsState {
</span><span class="boring">    Alabama,

        _ =&gt; count += 1,
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Or we could use an <code>if let</code> and <code>else</code> expression like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#[derive(Debug)]

<p>If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to
express using a <code>match</code>, remember that <code>if let</code> is in your Rust toolbox as well.</p>

<h2 id="summary-5"><a class="header" href="#summary-5">Summary</a></h2>
<p>We’ve now covered how to use enums to create custom types that can be one of a
set of enumerated values. We’ve shown how the standard library’s <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>
type helps you use the type system to prevent errors. When enum values have
data inside them, you can use <code>match</code> or <code>if let</code> to extract and use those
values, depending on how many cases you need to handle.</p>
<p>Your Rust programs can now express concepts in your domain using structs and
enums. Creating custom types to use in your API ensures type safety: the
compiler will make certain your functions get only values of the type each
function expects.</p>
<p>In order to provide a well-organized API to your users that is straightforward
to use and only exposes exactly what your users will need, let’s now turn to
Rust’s modules.</p>

<p>As you write large programs, organizing your code will become increasingly
important. By grouping related functionality and separating code with distinct
features, you’ll clarify where to find code that implements a particular
feature and where to go to change how a feature works.</p>
<p>The programs we’ve written so far have been in one module in one file. As a
project grows, you should organize code by splitting it into multiple modules
and then multiple files. A package can contain multiple binary crates and
optionally one library crate. As a package grows, you can extract parts into
separate crates that become external dependencies. This chapter covers all
these techniques. For very large projects comprising a set of interrelated
packages that evolve together, Cargo provides <em>workspaces</em>, which we’ll cover
in the <a href="ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html">“Cargo Workspaces”</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 14.</p>
<p>We’ll also discuss encapsulating implementation details, which lets you reuse
code at a higher level: once you’ve implemented an operation, other code can
call your code via its public interface without having to know how the
implementation works. The way you write code defines which parts are public for
other code to use and which parts are private implementation details that you
reserve the right to change. This is another way to limit the amount of detail
you have to keep in your head.</p>
<p>A related concept is scope: the nested context in which code is written has a
set of names that are defined as “in scope.” When reading, writing, and
compiling code, programmers and compilers need to know whether a particular
name at a particular spot refers to a variable, function, struct, enum, module,
constant, or other item and what that item means. You can create scopes and
change which names are in or out of scope. You can’t have two items with the
same name in the same scope; tools are available to resolve name conflicts.</p>
<p>Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your code’s
organization, including which details are exposed, which details are private,
and what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes
collectively referred to as the <em>module system</em>, include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Packages:</strong> A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates</li>
<li><strong>Crates:</strong> A tree of modules that produces a library or executable</li>
<li><strong>Modules</strong> and <strong>use:</strong> Let you control the organization, scope, and
privacy of paths</li>
<li><strong>Paths:</strong> A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll cover all these features, discuss how they interact, and
explain how to use them to manage scope. By the end, you should have a solid
understanding of the module system and be able to work with scopes like a pro!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="packages-and-crates"><a class="header" href="#packages-and-crates">Packages and Crates</a></h2>
<p>The first parts of the module system we’ll cover are packages and crates.</p>
<p>A <em>crate</em> is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a
time. Even if you run <code>rustc</code> rather than <code>cargo</code> and pass a single source code
file (as we did all the way back in the “Writing and Running a Rust Program”
section of Chapter 1), the compiler considers that file to be a crate. Crates
can contain modules, and the modules may be defined in other files that get
compiled with the crate, as we’ll see in the coming sections.</p>
<p>A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate.
<em>Binary crates</em> are programs you can compile to an executable that you can run,
such as a command-line program or a server. Each must have a function called
<code>main</code> that defines what happens when the executable runs. All the crates we’ve
created so far have been binary crates.</p>
<p><em>Library crates</em> don’t have a <code>main</code> function, and they don’t compile to an
executable. Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared with
multiple projects. For example, the <code>rand</code> crate we used in <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#generating-a-random-number">Chapter
2</a><!-- ignore --> provides functionality that generates random numbers.
Most of the time when Rustaceans say “crate”, they mean library crate, and they
use “crate” interchangeably with the general programming concept of a “library&quot;.</p>
<p>The <em>crate root</em> is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes
up the root module of your crate (we’ll explain modules in depth in the
<a href="ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html">“Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy”</a><!-- ignore -->
section).</p>
<p>A <em>package</em> is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of
functionality. A package contains a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file that describes how to
build those crates. Cargo is actually a package that contains the binary crate
for the command-line tool you’ve been using to build your code. The Cargo
package also contains a library crate that the binary crate depends on. Other
projects can depend on the Cargo library crate to use the same logic the Cargo
command-line tool uses.</p>
<p>A package can contain as many binary crates as you like, but at most only one
library crate. A package must contain at least one crate, whether that’s a
library or binary crate.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through what happens when we create a package. First, we enter the
command <code>cargo new</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new my-project
     Created binary (application) `my-project` package
$ ls my-project
Cargo.toml
src
$ ls my-project/src
main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>After we run <code>cargo new</code>, we use <code>ls</code> to see what Cargo creates. In the project
directory, there’s a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file, giving us a package. There’s also a
<em>src</em> directory that contains <em>main.rs</em>. Open <em>Cargo.toml</em> in your text editor,
and note there’s no mention of <em>src/main.rs</em>. Cargo follows a convention that
<em>src/main.rs</em> is the crate root of a binary crate with the same name as the
package. Likewise, Cargo knows that if the package directory contains
<em>src/lib.rs</em>, the package contains a library crate with the same name as the
package, and <em>src/lib.rs</em> is its crate root. Cargo passes the crate root files
to <code>rustc</code> to build the library or binary.</p>
<p>Here, we have a package that only contains <em>src/main.rs</em>, meaning it only
contains a binary crate named <code>my-project</code>. If a package contains <em>src/main.rs</em>
and <em>src/lib.rs</em>, it has two crates: a binary and a library, both with the same
name as the package. A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files
in the <em>src/bin</em> directory: each file will be a separate binary crate.</p>

<p>In this section, we’ll talk about modules and other parts of the module system,
namely <em>paths</em> that allow you to name items; the <code>use</code> keyword that brings a
path into scope; and the <code>pub</code> keyword to make items public. We’ll also discuss
the <code>as</code> keyword, external packages, and the glob operator.</p>
<p>First, we’re going to start with a list of rules for easy reference when you’re
organizing your code in the future. Then we’ll explain each of the rules in
detail.</p>
<h3 id="modules-cheat-sheet"><a class="header" href="#modules-cheat-sheet">Modules Cheat Sheet</a></h3>
<p>Here we provide a quick reference on how modules, paths, the <code>use</code> keyword, and
the <code>pub</code> keyword work in the compiler, and how most developers organize their
code. We’ll be going through examples of each of these rules throughout this
chapter, but this is a great place to refer to as a reminder of how modules
work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start from the crate root</strong>: When compiling a crate, the compiler first
looks in the crate root file (usually <em>src/lib.rs</em> for a library crate or
<em>src/main.rs</em> for a binary crate) for code to compile.</li>
<li><strong>Declaring modules</strong>: In the crate root file, you can declare new modules;
say, you declare a “garden” module with <code>mod garden;</code>. The compiler will look
for the module’s code in these places:
<ul>
<li>Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following <code>mod garden</code></li>
<li>In the file <em>src/garden.rs</em></li>
<li>In the file <em>src/garden/mod.rs</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Declaring submodules</strong>: In any file other than the crate root, you can
declare submodules. For example, you might declare <code>mod vegetables;</code> in
<em>src/garden.rs</em>. The compiler will look for the submodule’s code within the
directory named for the parent module in these places:
<ul>
<li>Inline, directly following <code>mod vegetables</code>, within curly brackets instead
of the semicolon</li>
<li>In the file <em>src/garden/vegetables.rs</em></li>
<li>In the file <em>src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Paths to code in modules</strong>: Once a module is part of your crate, you can
refer to code in that module from anywhere else in that same crate, as long
as the privacy rules allow, using the path to the code. For example, an
<code>Asparagus</code> type in the garden vegetables module would be found at
<code>crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Private vs public</strong>: Code within a module is private from its parent
modules by default. To make a module public, declare it with <code>pub mod</code>
instead of <code>mod</code>. To make items within a public module public as well, use
<code>pub</code> before their declarations.</li>
<li><strong>The <code>use</code> keyword</strong>: Within a scope, the <code>use</code> keyword creates shortcuts to
items to reduce repetition of long paths. In any scope that can refer to
<code>crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus</code>, you can create a shortcut with <code>use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;</code> and from then on you only need to
write <code>Asparagus</code> to make use of that type in the scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we create a binary crate named <code>backyard</code> that illustrates these rules. The
crate’s directory, also named <code>backyard</code>, contains these files and directories:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">backyard
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── garden
    │   └── vegetables.rs
    ├── garden.rs
    └── main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>The crate root file in this case is <em>src/main.rs</em>, and it contains:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground ignore">use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;

pub mod garden;

fn main() {
    let plant = Asparagus {};
    println!(&quot;I'm growing {:?}!&quot;, plant);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pub mod garden;</code> line tells the compiler to include the code it finds in
<em>src/garden.rs</em>, which is:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/garden.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground ignore">pub mod vegetables;
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>pub mod vegetables;</code> means the code in <em>src/garden/vegetables.rs</em> is
included too. That code is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground ignore">#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Asparagus {}
</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s get into the details of these rules and demonstrate them in action!</p>
<h3 id="grouping-related-code-in-modules"><a class="header" href="#grouping-related-code-in-modules">Grouping Related Code in Modules</a></h3>
<p><em>Modules</em> let us organize code within a crate for readability and easy reuse.
Modules also allow us to control the <em>privacy</em> of items, because code within a
module is private by default. Private items are internal implementation details
not available for outside use. We can choose to make modules and the items
within them public, which exposes them to allow external code to use and depend
on them.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s write a library crate that provides the functionality of a
restaurant. We’ll define the signatures of functions but leave their bodies
empty to concentrate on the organization of the code, rather than the
implementation of a restaurant.</p>
<p>In the restaurant industry, some parts of a restaurant are referred to as
<em>front of house</em> and others as <em>back of house</em>. Front of house is where
customers are; this encompasses where the hosts seat customers, servers take
orders and payment, and bartenders make drinks. Back of house is where the
chefs and cooks work in the kitchen, dishwashers clean up, and managers do
administrative work.</p>
<p>To structure our crate in this way, we can organize its functions into nested
modules. Create a new library named <code>restaurant</code> by running <code>cargo new restaurant --lib</code>; then enter the code in Listing 7-1 into <em>src/lib.rs</em> to
define some modules and function signatures. Here’s the front of house section:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}

        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}

        fn serve_order() {}

        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-1: A <code>front_of_house</code> module containing other
modules that then contain functions</span></p>
<p>We define a module with the <code>mod</code> keyword followed by the name of the module
(in this case, <code>front_of_house</code>). The body of the module then goes inside curly
brackets. Inside modules, we can place other modules, as in this case with the
modules <code>hosting</code> and <code>serving</code>. Modules can also hold definitions for other
items, such as structs, enums, constants, traits, and—as in Listing
7-1—functions.</p>
<p>By using modules, we can group related definitions together and name why
they’re related. Programmers using this code can navigate the code based on the
groups rather than having to read through all the definitions, making it easier
to find the definitions relevant to them. Programmers adding new functionality
to this code would know where to place the code to keep the program organized.</p>
<p>Earlier, we mentioned that <em>src/main.rs</em> and <em>src/lib.rs</em> are called crate
roots. The reason for their name is that the contents of either of these two
files form a module named <code>crate</code> at the root of the crate’s module structure,
known as the <em>module tree</em>.</p>
<p>Listing 7-2 shows the module tree for the structure in Listing 7-1.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">crate
 └── front_of_house
     ├── hosting
     │   ├── add_to_waitlist
     │   └── seat_at_table
     └── serving
         ├── take_order
         ├── serve_order
         └── take_payment
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-2: The module tree for the code in Listing
7-1</span></p>
<p>This tree shows how some of the modules nest inside one another; for example,
<code>hosting</code> nests inside <code>front_of_house</code>. The tree also shows that some modules
are <em>siblings</em> to each other, meaning they’re defined in the same module;
<code>hosting</code> and <code>serving</code> are siblings defined within <code>front_of_house</code>. If module
A is contained inside module B, we say that module A is the <em>child</em> of module B
and that module B is the <em>parent</em> of module A. Notice that the entire module
tree is rooted under the implicit module named <code>crate</code>.</p>
<p>The module tree might remind you of the filesystem’s directory tree on your
computer; this is a very apt comparison! Just like directories in a filesystem,
you use modules to organize your code. And just like files in a directory, we
need a way to find our modules.</p>

<p>To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in the same
way we use a path when navigating a filesystem. To call a function, we need to
know its path.</p>
<p>A path can take two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <em>absolute path</em> is the full path starting from a crate root; for code
from an external crate, the absolute path begins with the crate name, and for
code from the current crate, it starts with the literal <code>crate</code>.</li>
<li>A <em>relative path</em> starts from the current module and uses <code>self</code>, <code>super</code>, or
an identifier in the current module.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers
separated by double colons (<code>::</code>).</p>
<p>Returning to Listing 7-1, say we want to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function.
This is the same as asking: what’s the path of the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function?
Listing 7-3 contains Listing 7-1 with some of the modules and functions
removed.</p>
<p>We’ll show two ways to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function from a new function
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> defined in the crate root. These paths are correct, but
there’s another problem remaining that will prevent this example from compiling
as-is. We’ll explain why in a bit.</p>
<p>The <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function is part of our library crate’s public API, so
we mark it with the <code>pub</code> keyword. In the <a href="ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html#exposing-paths-with-the-pub-keyword">“Exposing Paths with the <code>pub</code>
Keyword”</a><!-- ignore --> section, we’ll go into more detail about <code>pub</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-3: Calling the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function using
absolute and relative paths</span></p>
<p>The first time we call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>,
we use an absolute path. The <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is defined in the same
crate as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, which means we can use the <code>crate</code> keyword to
start an absolute path. We then include each of the successive modules until we
make our way to <code>add_to_waitlist</code>. You can imagine a filesystem with the same
structure: we’d specify the path <code>/front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist</code> to
run the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> program; using the <code>crate</code> name to start from the
crate root is like using <code>/</code> to start from the filesystem root in your shell.</p>
<p>The second time we call <code>add_to_waitlist</code> in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, we use a
relative path. The path starts with <code>front_of_house</code>, the name of the module
defined at the same level of the module tree as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>. Here the
filesystem equivalent would be using the path
<code>front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist</code>. Starting with a module name means
that the path is relative.</p>
<p>Choosing whether to use a relative or absolute path is a decision you’ll make
based on your project, and depends on whether you’re more likely to move item
definition code separately from or together with the code that uses the item.
For example, if we move the <code>front_of_house</code> module and the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>
function into a module named <code>customer_experience</code>, we’d need to update the
absolute path to <code>add_to_waitlist</code>, but the relative path would still be valid.
However, if we moved the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function separately into a module
named <code>dining</code>, the absolute path to the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> call would stay the
same, but the relative path would need to be updated. Our preference in general
is to specify absolute paths because it’s more likely we’ll want to move code
definitions and item calls independently of each other.</p>
<p>Let’s try to compile Listing 7-3 and find out why it won’t compile yet! The
error we get is shown in Listing 7-4.</p>

<p>The error messages say that module <code>hosting</code> is private. In other words, we
have the correct paths for the <code>hosting</code> module and the <code>add_to_waitlist</code>
function, but Rust won’t let us use them because it doesn’t have access to the
private sections. In Rust, all items (functions, methods, structs, enums,
modules, and constants) are private to parent modules by default. If you want
to make an item like a function or struct private, you put it in a module.</p>
<p>Items in a parent module can’t use the private items inside child modules, but
items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. This is
because child modules wrap and hide their implementation details, but the child
modules can see the context in which they’re defined. To continue with our
metaphor, think of the privacy rules as being like the back office of a
restaurant: what goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but
office managers can see and do everything in the restaurant they operate.</p>
<p>Rust chose to have the module system function this way so that hiding inner
implementation details is the default. That way, you know which parts of the
inner code you can change without breaking outer code. However, Rust does give
you the option to expose inner parts of child modules’ code to outer ancestor
modules by using the <code>pub</code> keyword to make an item public.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-6: Compiler errors from building the code in
Listing 7-5</span></p>
<p>What happened? Adding the <code>pub</code> keyword in front of <code>mod hosting</code> makes the
module public. With this change, if we can access <code>front_of_house</code>, we can
access <code>hosting</code>. But the <em>contents</em> of <code>hosting</code> are still private; making the
module public doesn’t make its contents public. The <code>pub</code> keyword on a module
only lets code in its ancestor modules refer to it, not access its inner code.
Because modules are containers, there’s not much we can do by only making the
module public; we need to go further and choose to make one or more of the
items within the module public as well.</p>
<p>The errors in Listing 7-6 say that the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is private.
The privacy rules apply to structs, enums, functions, and methods as well as
modules.</p>
<p>Let’s also make the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function public by adding the <code>pub</code>
keyword before its definition, as in Listing 7-7.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground test_harness">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-7: Adding the <code>pub</code> keyword to <code>mod hosting</code>
and <code>fn add_to_waitlist</code> lets us call the function from
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code></span></p>
<p>Now the code will compile! To see why adding the <code>pub</code> keyword lets us use
these paths in <code>add_to_waitlist</code> with respect to the privacy rules, let’s look
at the absolute and the relative paths.</p>
<p>In the absolute path, we start with <code>crate</code>, the root of our crate’s module
tree. The <code>front_of_house</code> module is defined in the crate root. While
<code>front_of_house</code> isn’t public, because the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function is
defined in the same module as <code>front_of_house</code> (that is, <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>
and <code>front_of_house</code> are siblings), we can refer to <code>front_of_house</code> from
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code>. Next is the <code>hosting</code> module marked with <code>pub</code>. We can
access the parent module of <code>hosting</code>, so we can access <code>hosting</code>. Finally, the
<code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is marked with <code>pub</code> and we can access its parent
module, so this function call works!</p>
<p>In the relative path, the logic is the same as the absolute path except for the
first step: rather than starting from the crate root, the path starts from
<code>front_of_house</code>. The <code>front_of_house</code> module is defined within the same module
as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, so the relative path starting from the module in which
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> is defined works. Then, because <code>hosting</code> and
<code>add_to_waitlist</code> are marked with <code>pub</code>, the rest of the path works, and this
function call is valid!</p>
<p>If you plan on sharing your library crate so other projects can use your code,
your public API is your contract with users of your crate that determines how
they can interact with your code. There are many considerations around managing
changes to your public API to make it easier for people to depend on your
crate. These considerations are out of the scope of this book; if you’re
interested in this topic, see <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/">The Rust API Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>We mentioned a package can contain both a <em>src/main.rs</em> binary crate root as
well as a <em>src/lib.rs</em> library crate root, and both crates will have the
package name by default. Typically, packages with this pattern of containing
both a library and a binary crate will have just enough code in the binary
crate to start an executable that calls code with the library crate. This
lets other projects benefit from the most functionality that the package
provides, because the library crate’s code can be shared.</p>
<p>The module tree should be defined in <em>src/lib.rs</em>. Then, any public items can
be used in the binary crate by starting paths with the name of the package.
The binary crate becomes a user of the library crate just like a completely
external crate would use the library crate: it can only use the public API.
This helps you design a good API; not only are you the author, you’re also a
client!</p>
<p>In <a href="ch12-00-an-io-project.html">Chapter 12</a><!-- ignore -->, we’ll demonstrate this organizational
practice with a command-line program that will contain both a binary crate
and a library crate.</p>

<h3 id="starting-relative-paths-with-super"><a class="header" href="#starting-relative-paths-with-super">Starting Relative Paths with <code>super</code></a></h3>
<p>We can construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather than
the current module or the crate root, by using <code>super</code> at the start of the
path. This is like starting a filesystem path with the <code>..</code> syntax. Using
<code>super</code> allows us to reference an item that we know is in the parent module,
which can make rearranging the module tree easier when the module is closely
related to the parent, but the parent might be moved elsewhere in the module
tree someday.</p>
<p>Consider the code in Listing 7-8 that models the situation in which a chef
fixes an incorrect order and personally brings it out to the customer. The
function <code>fix_incorrect_order</code> defined in the <code>back_of_house</code> module calls the
function <code>deliver_order</code> defined in the parent module by specifying the path to
<code>deliver_order</code> starting with <code>super</code>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground test_harness">fn deliver_order() {}

mod back_of_house {
    fn fix_incorrect_order() {
        cook_order();
        super::deliver_order();
    }

    fn cook_order() {}
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-8: Calling a function using a relative path
starting with <code>super</code></span></p>
<p>The <code>fix_incorrect_order</code> function is in the <code>back_of_house</code> module, so we can
use <code>super</code> to go to the parent module of <code>back_of_house</code>, which in this case
is <code>crate</code>, the root. From there, we look for <code>deliver_order</code> and find it.
Success! We think the <code>back_of_house</code> module and the <code>deliver_order</code> function
are likely to stay in the same relationship to each other and get moved
together should we decide to reorganize the crate’s module tree. Therefore, we
used <code>super</code> so we’ll have fewer places to update code in the future if this
code gets moved to a different module.</p>
<h3 id="making-structs-and-enums-public"><a class="header" href="#making-structs-and-enums-public">Making Structs and Enums Public</a></h3>
<p>We can also use <code>pub</code> to designate structs and enums as public, but there are a
few details extra to the usage of <code>pub</code> with structs and enums. If we use <code>pub</code>
before a struct definition, we make the struct public, but the struct’s fields
will still be private. We can make each field public or not on a case-by-case
basis. In Listing 7-9, we’ve defined a public <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> struct
with a public <code>toast</code> field but a private <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field. This models
the case in a restaurant where the customer can pick the type of bread that
comes with a meal, but the chef decides which fruit accompanies the meal based
on what’s in season and in stock. The available fruit changes quickly, so
customers can’t choose the fruit or even see which fruit they’ll get.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">mod back_of_house {
    pub struct Breakfast {
        pub toast: String,
        seasonal_fruit: String,
    }

    impl Breakfast {
        pub fn summer(toast: &amp;str) -&gt; Breakfast {
            Breakfast {
                toast: String::from(toast),
                seasonal_fruit: String::from(&quot;peaches&quot;),
            }
        }
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Order a breakfast in the summer with Rye toast
    let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer(&quot;Rye&quot;);
    // Change our mind about what bread we'd like
    meal.toast = String::from(&quot;Wheat&quot;);
    println!(&quot;I'd like {} toast please&quot;, meal.toast);

    // The next line won't compile if we uncomment it; we're not allowed
    // to see or modify the seasonal fruit that comes with the meal
    // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from(&quot;blueberries&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-9: A struct with some public fields and some
private fields</span></p>
<p>Because the <code>toast</code> field in the <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> struct is public,
in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> we can write and read to the <code>toast</code> field using dot
notation. Notice that we can’t use the <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field in
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> because <code>seasonal_fruit</code> is private. Try uncommenting the
line modifying the <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field value to see what error you get!</p>
<p>Also, note that because <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> has a private field, the
struct needs to provide a public associated function that constructs an
instance of <code>Breakfast</code> (we’ve named it <code>summer</code> here). If <code>Breakfast</code> didn’t
have such a function, we couldn’t create an instance of <code>Breakfast</code> in
<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> because we couldn’t set the value of the private
<code>seasonal_fruit</code> field in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p>
<p>In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then public. We
only need the <code>pub</code> before the <code>enum</code> keyword, as shown in Listing 7-10.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">mod back_of_house {
    pub enum Appetizer {

}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
    let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-10: Designating an enum as public makes all its

<p>Because we made the <code>Appetizer</code> enum public, we can use the <code>Soup</code> and <code>Salad</code>
variants in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p>
<p>Enums aren’t very useful unless their variants are public; it would be annoying
to have to annotate all enum variants with <code>pub</code> in every case, so the default
for enum variants is to be public. Structs are often useful without their
fields being public, so struct fields follow the general rule of everything
being private by default unless annotated with <code>pub</code>.</p>
<p>There’s one more situation involving <code>pub</code> that we haven’t covered, and that is
our last module system feature: the <code>use</code> keyword. We’ll cover <code>use</code> by itself
first, and then we’ll show how to combine <code>pub</code> and <code>use</code>.</p>

<p>Having to write out the paths to call functions can feel inconvenient and
repetitive. In Listing 7-7, whether we chose the absolute or relative path to
the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function, every time we wanted to call <code>add_to_waitlist</code>
we had to specify <code>front_of_house</code> and <code>hosting</code> too. Fortunately, there’s a
way to simplify this process: we can create a shortcut to a path with the <code>use</code>
keyword once, and then use the shorter name everywhere else in the scope.</p>
<p>In Listing 7-11, we bring the <code>crate::front_of_house::hosting</code> module into the
scope of the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function so we only have to specify
<code>hosting::add_to_waitlist</code> to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function in

the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function to achieve the same result, as in Listing 7-13.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-13: Bringing the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function
into scope with <code>use</code>, which is unidiomatic</span></p>
<p>Although both Listing 7-11 and 7-13 accomplish the same task, Listing 7-11 is
the idiomatic way to bring a function into scope with <code>use</code>. Bringing the
function’s parent module into scope with <code>use</code> means we have to specify the
parent module when calling the function. Specifying the parent module when
calling the function makes it clear that the function isn’t locally defined
while still minimizing repetition of the full path. The code in Listing 7-13 is
unclear as to where <code>add_to_waitlist</code> is defined.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when bringing in structs, enums, and other items with <code>use</code>,
it’s idiomatic to specify the full path. Listing 7-14 shows the idiomatic way
to bring the standard library’s <code>HashMap</code> struct into the scope of a binary
crate.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-14: Bringing <code>HashMap</code> into scope in an
idiomatic way</span></p>
<p>There’s no strong reason behind this idiom: it’s just the convention that has
emerged, and folks have gotten used to reading and writing Rust code this way.</p>
<p>The exception to this idiom is if we’re bringing two items with the same name
into scope with <code>use</code> statements, because Rust doesn’t allow that. Listing 7-15
shows how to bring two <code>Result</code> types into scope that have the same name but
different parent modules and how to refer to them.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">use std::fmt;

</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-15: Bringing two types with the same name into

<p>As you can see, using the parent modules distinguishes the two <code>Result</code> types.
If instead we specified <code>use std::fmt::Result</code> and <code>use std::io::Result</code>, we’d
have two <code>Result</code> types in the same scope and Rust wouldn’t know which one we

into the same scope with <code>use</code>: after the path, we can specify <code>as</code> and a new
local name, or <em>alias</em>, for the type. Listing 7-16 shows another way to write
the code in Listing 7-15 by renaming one of the two <code>Result</code> types using <code>as</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">use std::fmt::Result;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;

fn function1() -&gt; Result {
    // --snip--
<span class="boring">    Ok(())
</span>}

fn function2() -&gt; IoResult&lt;()&gt; {
    // --snip--
<span class="boring">    Ok(())
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-16: Renaming a type when it’s brought into
scope with the <code>as</code> keyword</span></p>
<p>In the second <code>use</code> statement, we chose the new name <code>IoResult</code> for the
<code>std::io::Result</code> type, which won’t conflict with the <code>Result</code> from <code>std::fmt</code>
that we’ve also brought into scope. Listing 7-15 and Listing 7-16 are
considered idiomatic, so the choice is up to you!</p>
<h3 id="re-exporting-names-with-pub-use"><a class="header" href="#re-exporting-names-with-pub-use">Re-exporting Names with <code>pub use</code></a></h3>
<p>When we bring a name into scope with the <code>use</code> keyword, the name available in
the new scope is private. To enable the code that calls our code to refer to
that name as if it had been defined in that code’s scope, we can combine <code>pub</code>
and <code>use</code>. This technique is called <em>re-exporting</em> because we’re bringing
an item into scope but also making that item available for others to bring into
their scope.</p>
<p>Listing 7-17 shows the code in Listing 7-11 with <code>use</code> in the root module
changed to <code>pub use</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground test_harness">mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-17: Making a name available for any code to use
from a new scope with <code>pub use</code></span></p>
<p>Before this change, external code would have to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code>
function by using the path
<code>restaurant::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist()</code>. Now that this <code>pub use</code> has re-exported the <code>hosting</code> module from the root module, external code
can now use the path <code>restaurant::hosting::add_to_waitlist()</code> instead.</p>
<p>Re-exporting is useful when the internal structure of your code is different
from how programmers calling your code would think about the domain. For
example, in this restaurant metaphor, the people running the restaurant think
about “front of house” and “back of house.” But customers visiting a restaurant
probably won’t think about the parts of the restaurant in those terms. With
<code>pub use</code>, we can write our code with one structure but expose a different
structure. Doing so makes our library well organized for programmers working on
the library and programmers calling the library. We’ll look at another example
of <code>pub use</code> and how it affects your crate’s documentation in the <a href="ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html#exporting-a-convenient-public-api-with-pub-use">“Exporting a
Convenient Public API with <code>pub use</code>”</a><!-- ignore --> section of
Chapter 14.</p>
<h3 id="using-external-packages"><a class="header" href="#using-external-packages">Using External Packages</a></h3>
<p>In Chapter 2, we programmed a guessing game project that used an external
package called <code>rand</code> to get random numbers. To use <code>rand</code> in our project, we
added this line to <em>Cargo.toml</em>:</p>
<!-- When updating the version of `rand` used, also update the version of
`rand` used in these files so they all match:
* ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.md
* ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.md
-->
<p><span class="filename">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">rand = &quot;0.8.3&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Adding <code>rand</code> as a dependency in <em>Cargo.toml</em> tells Cargo to download the
<code>rand</code> package and any dependencies from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> and
make <code>rand</code> available to our project.</p>
<p>Then, to bring <code>rand</code> definitions into the scope of our package, we added a
<code>use</code> line starting with the name of the crate, <code>rand</code>, and listed the items
we wanted to bring into scope. Recall that in the <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#generating-a-random-number">“Generating a Random
Number”</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 2, we brought the <code>Rng</code> trait
into scope and called the <code>rand::thread_rng</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use std::io;
</span>use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
<span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span>    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
<span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;The secret number is: {secret_number}&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">

</span><span class="boring">        .expect(&quot;Failed to read line&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;You guessed: {guess}&quot;);
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>Members of the Rust community have made many packages available at
<a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>, and pulling any of them into your package
involves these same steps: listing them in your package’s <em>Cargo.toml</em> file and
using <code>use</code> to bring items from their crates into scope.</p>
<p>Note that the standard <code>std</code> library is also a crate that’s external to our
package. Because the standard library is shipped with the Rust language, we
don’t need to change <em>Cargo.toml</em> to include <code>std</code>. But we do need to refer to
it with <code>use</code> to bring items from there into our package’s scope. For example,
with <code>HashMap</code> we would use this line:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use std::collections::HashMap;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This is an absolute path starting with <code>std</code>, the name of the standard library
crate.</p>

<p>If we’re using multiple items defined in the same crate or same module,
listing each item on its own line can take up a lot of vertical space in our
files. For example, these two <code>use</code> statements we had in the Guessing Game in
Listing 2-4 bring items from <code>std</code> into scope:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use rand::Rng;
</span>// --snip--

</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;Guess the number!&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
</span><span class="boring">

</span><span class="boring">

</span><span class="boring">    }
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Instead, we can use nested paths to bring the same items into scope in one
line. We do this by specifying the common part of the path, followed by two
colons, and then curly brackets around a list of the parts of the paths that
differ, as shown in Listing 7-18.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-18: Specifying a nested path to bring multiple
items with the same prefix into scope</span></p>
<p>In bigger programs, bringing many items into scope from the same crate or
module using nested paths can reduce the number of separate <code>use</code> statements
needed by a lot!</p>
<p>We can use a nested path at any level in a path, which is useful when combining
two <code>use</code> statements that share a subpath. For example, Listing 7-19 shows two
<code>use</code> statements: one that brings <code>std::io</code> into scope and one that brings
<code>std::io::Write</code> into scope.</p>

<p>The common part of these two paths is <code>std::io</code>, and that’s the complete first

<h3 id="the-glob-operator"><a class="header" href="#the-glob-operator">The Glob Operator</a></h3>
<p>If we want to bring <em>all</em> public items defined in a path into scope, we can
specify that path followed by the <code>*</code> glob operator:</p>

<p>This <code>use</code> statement brings all public items defined in <code>std::collections</code> into
the current scope. Be careful when using the glob operator! Glob can make it
harder to tell what names are in scope and where a name used in your program
was defined.</p>
<p>The glob operator is often used when testing to bring everything under test
into the <code>tests</code> module; we’ll talk about that in the <a href="ch11-01-writing-tests.html#how-to-write-tests">“How to Write

<p>So far, all the examples in this chapter defined multiple modules in one file.
When modules get large, you might want to move their definitions to a separate
file to make the code easier to navigate.</p>
<p>For example, let’s start from the code in Listing 7-17 that had multiple
restaurant modules. We’ll extract modules into files instead of having all the
modules defined in the crate root file. In this case, the crate root file is
<em>src/lib.rs</em>, but this procedure also works with binary crates whose crate root
file is <em>src/main.rs</em>.</p>
<p>First, we’ll extract the <code>front_of_house</code> module to its own file. Remove the
code inside the curly brackets for the <code>front_of_house</code> module, leaving only
the <code>mod front_of_house;</code> declaration, so that <em>src/lib.rs</em> contains the code
shown in Listing 7-21. Note that this won’t compile until we create the
<em>src/front_of_house.rs</em> file in Listing 7-22.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">mod front_of_house;

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-21: Declaring the <code>front_of_house</code> module whose
body will be in <em>src/front_of_house.rs</em></span></p>
<p>Next, place the code that was in the curly brackets into a new file named
<em>src/front_of_house.rs</em>, as shown in Listing 7-22. The compiler knows to look
in this file because it came across the module declaration in the crate root
with the name <code>front_of_house</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/front_of_house.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub mod hosting {
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 7-22: Definitions inside the <code>front_of_house</code>
module in <em>src/front_of_house.rs</em></span></p>
<p>Note that you only need to load a file using a <code>mod</code> declaration <em>once</em> in your
module tree. Once the compiler knows the file is part of the project (and knows
where in the module tree the code resides because of where you’ve put the <code>mod</code>
statement), other files in your project should refer to the loaded file’s code
using a path to where it was declared, as covered in the <a href="ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html">“Paths for Referring
to an Item in the Module Tree”</a><!-- ignore --> section. In other words,
<code>mod</code> is <em>not</em> an “include” operation that you may have seen in other
programming languages.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll extract the <code>hosting</code> module to its own file. The process is a bit
different because <code>hosting</code> is a child module of <code>front_of_house</code>, not of the
root module. We’ll place the file for <code>hosting</code> in a new directory that will be
named for its ancestors in the module tree, in this case <em>src/front_of_house/</em>.</p>
<p>To start moving <code>hosting</code>, we change <em>src/front_of_house.rs</em> to contain only the
declaration of the <code>hosting</code> module:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/front_of_house.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub mod hosting;
</code></pre>
<p>Then we create a <em>src/front_of_house</em> directory and a file <em>hosting.rs</em> to
contain the definitions made in the <code>hosting</code> module:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/front_of_house/hosting.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
</code></pre>
<p>If we instead put <em>hosting.rs</em> in the <em>src</em> directory, the compiler would
expect the <em>hosting.rs</em> code to be in a <code>hosting</code> module declared in the crate
root, and not declared as a child of the <code>front_of_house</code> module. The
compiler’s rules for which files to check for which modules’ code means the
directories and files more closely match the module tree.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="alternate-file-paths"><a class="header" href="#alternate-file-paths">Alternate File Paths</a></h3>
<p>So far we’ve covered the most idiomatic file paths the Rust compiler uses,
but Rust also supports an older style of file path. For a module named
<code>front_of_house</code> declared in the crate root, the compiler will look for the
module’s code in:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>src/front_of_house.rs</em> (what we covered)</li>
<li><em>src/front_of_house/mod.rs</em> (older style, still supported path)</li>
</ul>
<p>For a module named <code>hosting</code> that is a submodule of <code>front_of_house</code>, the
compiler will look for the module’s code in:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>src/front_of_house/hosting.rs</em> (what we covered)</li>
<li><em>src/front_of_house/hosting/mod.rs</em> (older style, still supported path)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use both styles for the same module, you’ll get a compiler error. Using
a mix of both styles for different modules in the same project is allowed, but
might be confusing for people navigating your project.</p>
<p>The main downside to the style that uses files named <em>mod.rs</em> is that your
project can end up with many files named <em>mod.rs</em>, which can get confusing
when you have them open in your editor at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve moved each module’s code to a separate file, and the module tree remains
the same. The function calls in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> will work without any
modification, even though the definitions live in different files. This
technique lets you move modules to new files as they grow in size.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting</code> statement in
<em>src/lib.rs</em> also hasn’t changed, nor does <code>use</code> have any impact on what files
are compiled as part of the crate. The <code>mod</code> keyword declares modules, and Rust
looks in a file with the same name as the module for the code that goes into
that module.</p>

<h2 id="summary-6"><a class="header" href="#summary-6">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Rust lets you split a package into multiple crates and a crate into modules
so you can refer to items defined in one module from another module. You can do
this by specifying absolute or relative paths. These paths can be brought into
scope with a <code>use</code> statement so you can use a shorter path for multiple uses of
the item in that scope. Module code is private by default, but you can make
definitions public by adding the <code>pub</code> keyword.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll look at some collection data structures in the
standard library that you can use in your neatly organized code.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="mdbook-quiz/embed.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mdbook-quiz/embed.css"><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="common-collections"><a class="header" href="#common-collections">Common Collections</a></h1>
<p>Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called
<em>collections</em>. Most other data types represent one specific value, but
collections can contain multiple values. Unlike the built-in array and tuple
types, the data these collections point to is stored on the heap, which means
the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or
shrink as the program runs. Each kind of collection has different capabilities
and costs, and choosing an appropriate one for your current situation is a
skill you’ll develop over time. In this chapter, we’ll discuss three
collections that are used very often in Rust programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>vector</em> allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.</li>
<li>A <em>string</em> is a collection of characters. We’ve mentioned the <code>String</code> type
previously, but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.</li>
<li>A <em>hash map</em> allows you to associate a value with a particular key. It’s a
particular implementation of the more general data structure called a <em>map</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn about the other kinds of collections provided by the standard library,
see <a href="../std/collections/index.html">the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss how to create and update vectors, strings, and hash maps, as well
as what makes each special.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="storing-lists-of-values-with-vectors"><a class="header" href="#storing-lists-of-values-with-vectors">Storing Lists of Values with Vectors</a></h2>
<p>The first collection type we’ll look at is <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, also known as a <em>vector</em>.
Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that
puts all the values next to each other in memory. Vectors can only store values
of the same type. They are useful when you have a list of items, such as the
lines of text in a file or the prices of items in a shopping cart.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-vector"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-vector">Creating a New Vector</a></h3>
<p>To create a new empty vector, we call the <code>Vec::new</code> function, as shown in
Listing 8-1.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-1: Creating a new, empty vector to hold values
of type <code>i32</code></span></p>
<p>Note that we added a type annotation here. Because we aren’t inserting any
values into this vector, Rust doesn’t know what kind of elements we intend to
store. This is an important point. Vectors are implemented using generics;
we’ll cover how to use generics with your own types in Chapter 10. For now,
know that the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> type provided by the standard library can hold any type.
When we create a vector to hold a specific type, we can specify the type within
angle brackets. In Listing 8-1, we’ve told Rust that the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> in <code>v</code> will
hold elements of the <code>i32</code> type.</p>
<p>More often, you’ll create a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> with initial values and Rust will infer
the type of value you want to store, so you rarely need to do this type
annotation. Rust conveniently provides the <code>vec!</code> macro, which will create a
new vector that holds the values you give it. Listing 8-2 creates a new
<code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> that holds the values <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>. The integer type is <code>i32</code>
because that’s the default integer type, as we discussed in the <a href="ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types">“Data
Types”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 3.</p>

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-2: Creating a new vector containing
values</span></p>
<p>Because we’ve given initial <code>i32</code> values, Rust can infer that the type of <code>v</code>
is <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code>, and the type annotation isn’t necessary. Next, we’ll look at how
to modify a vector.</p>
<h3 id="updating-a-vector"><a class="header" href="#updating-a-vector">Updating a Vector</a></h3>
<p>To create a vector and then add elements to it, we can use the <code>push</code> method,
as shown in Listing 8-3.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut v = Vec::new();

    v.push(5);
    v.push(6);
    v.push(7);
    v.push(8);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-3: Using the <code>push</code> method to add values to a
vector</span></p>
<p>As with any variable, if we want to be able to change its value, we need to
make it mutable using the <code>mut</code> keyword, as discussed in Chapter 3. The numbers
we place inside are all of type <code>i32</code>, and Rust infers this from the data, so
we don’t need the <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> annotation.</p>
<h3 id="reading-elements-of-vectors"><a class="header" href="#reading-elements-of-vectors">Reading Elements of Vectors</a></h3>
<p>There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector: via indexing or
using the <code>get</code> method. In the following examples, we’ve annotated the types of
the values that are returned from these functions for extra clarity.</p>
<p>Listing 8-4 shows both methods of accessing a value in a vector, with indexing
syntax and the <code>get</code> method.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let third: &amp;i32 = &amp;v[2];
    println!(&quot;The third element is {}&quot;, third);

    let third: Option&lt;&amp;i32&gt; = v.get(2);
    match third {
        Some(third) =&gt; println!(&quot;The third element is {}&quot;, third),
        None =&gt; println!(&quot;There is no third element.&quot;),
    }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-4: Using indexing syntax or the <code>get</code> method to
access an item in a vector</span></p>
<p>Note a few details here. We use the index value of <code>2</code> to get the third element
because vectors are indexed by number, starting at zero. Using <code>&amp;</code> and <code>[]</code>
gives us a reference to the element at the index value. When we use the <code>get</code>
method with the index passed as an argument, we get an <code>Option&lt;&amp;T&gt;</code> that we can
use with <code>match</code>.</p>
<p>The reason Rust provides these two ways to reference an element is so you can
choose how the program behaves when you try to use an index value outside the
range of existing elements. As an example, let’s see what happens when we have
a vector of five elements and then we try to access an element at index 100
with each technique, as shown in Listing 8-5.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust should_panic panics"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let does_not_exist = &amp;v[100];
    let does_not_exist = v.get(100);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-5: Attempting to access the element at index
100 in a vector containing five elements</span></p>
<p>When we run this code, the first <code>[]</code> method will cause the program to panic
because it references a nonexistent element. This method is best used when you
want your program to crash if there’s an attempt to access an element past the
end of the vector.</p>
<p>When the <code>get</code> method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it returns
<code>None</code> without panicking. You would use this method if accessing an element
beyond the range of the vector may happen occasionally under normal
circumstances. Your code will then have logic to handle having either
<code>Some(&amp;element)</code> or <code>None</code>, as discussed in Chapter 6. For example, the index
could be coming from a person entering a number. If they accidentally enter a
number that’s too large and the program gets a <code>None</code> value, you could tell the
user how many items are in the current vector and give them another chance to
enter a valid value. That would be more user-friendly than crashing the program
due to a typo!</p>
<p>When the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the
ownership and borrowing rules (covered in Chapter 4) to ensure this reference
and any other references to the contents of the vector remain valid. Recall the
rule that states you can’t have mutable and immutable references in the same
scope. That rule applies in Listing 8-6, where we hold an immutable reference
to the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the end. This
program won’t work if we also try to refer to that element later in the
function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile"><span class="boring">fn main() {

</code></pre>
<p>The code in Listing 8-6 might look like it should work: why should a reference
to the first element care about changes at the end of the vector? This error is
due to the way vectors work: because vectors put the values next to each other
in memory, adding a new element onto the end of the vector might require
allocating new memory and copying the old elements to the new space, if there
isn’t enough room to put all the elements next to each other where the vector
is currently stored. In that case, the reference to the first element would be
pointing to deallocated memory. The borrowing rules prevent programs from
ending up in that situation.</p>

<p>To access each element in a vector in turn, we would iterate through all of the
elements rather than use indices to access one at a time. Listing 8-7 shows how
to use a <code>for</code> loop to get immutable references to each element in a vector of
<code>i32</code> values and print them.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let v = vec![100, 32, 57];

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-7: Printing each element in a vector by
iterating over the elements using a <code>for</code> loop</span></p>
<p>We can also iterate over mutable references to each element in a mutable vector
in order to make changes to all the elements. The <code>for</code> loop in Listing 8-8
will add <code>50</code> to each element.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];

<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-8: Iterating over mutable references to
elements in a vector</span></p>
<p>To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use the
<code>*</code> dereference operator to get to the value in <code>i</code> before we can use the <code>+=</code>
operator. We’ll talk more about the dereference operator in the <a href="ch15-02-deref.html#following-the-pointer-to-the-value-with-the-dereference-operator">“Following the

section of Chapter 15.</p>
<p>Iterating over a vector, whether immutably or mutably, is safe because of the
borrow checker's rules. If we attempted to insert or remove items in the <code>for</code>
loop bodies in Listing 8-7 and Listing 8-8, we would get a compiler error
similar to the one we got with the code in Listing 8-6. The reference to the
vector that the <code>for</code> loop holds prevents simultaneous modification of the
whole vector.</p>
<h3 id="using-an-enum-to-store-multiple-types"><a class="header" href="#using-an-enum-to-store-multiple-types">Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types</a></h3>
<p>Vectors can only store values that are the same type. This can be inconvenient;
there are definitely use cases for needing to store a list of items of
different types. Fortunately, the variants of an enum are defined under the
same enum type, so when we need one type to represent elements of different
types, we can define and use an enum!</p>
<p>For example, say we want to get values from a row in a spreadsheet in which
some of the columns in the row contain integers, some floating-point numbers,
and some strings. We can define an enum whose variants will hold the different
value types, and all the enum variants will be considered the same type: that
of the enum. Then we can create a vector to hold that enum and so, ultimately,
holds different types. We’ve demonstrated this in Listing 8-9.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    enum SpreadsheetCell {
        Int(i32),

        SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),

<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-9: Defining an <code>enum</code> to store values of
different types in one vector</span></p>
<p>Rust needs to know what types will be in the vector at compile time so it knows
exactly how much memory on the heap will be needed to store each element. We
must also be explicit about what types are allowed in this vector. If Rust
allowed a vector to hold any type, there would be a chance that one or more of
the types would cause errors with the operations performed on the elements of
the vector. Using an enum plus a <code>match</code> expression means that Rust will ensure
at compile time that every possible case is handled, as discussed in Chapter 6.</p>
<p>If you don’t know the exhaustive set of types a program will get at runtime to
store in a vector, the enum technique won’t work. Instead, you can use a trait
object, which we’ll cover in Chapter 17.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed some of the most common ways to use vectors, be sure
to review <a href="../std/vec/struct.Vec.html">the API documentation</a><!-- ignore --> for all the many
useful methods defined on <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> by the standard library. For example, in

<p>We talked about strings in Chapter 4, but we’ll look at them in more depth now.
New Rustaceans commonly get stuck on strings for a combination of three
reasons: Rust’s propensity for exposing possible errors, strings being a more
complicated data structure than many programmers give them credit for, and
UTF-8. These factors combine in a way that can seem difficult when you’re
coming from other programming languages.</p>
<p>We discuss strings in the context of collections because strings are
implemented as a collection of bytes, plus some methods to provide useful
functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text. In this section, we’ll
talk about the operations on <code>String</code> that every collection type has, such as
creating, updating, and reading. We’ll also discuss the ways in which <code>String</code>
is different from the other collections, namely how indexing into a <code>String</code> is
complicated by the differences between how people and computers interpret
<code>String</code> data.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-string"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-string">What Is a String?</a></h3>
<p>We’ll first define what we mean by the term <em>string</em>. Rust has only one string
type in the core language, which is the string slice <code>str</code> that is usually seen
in its borrowed form <code>&amp;str</code>. In Chapter 4, we talked about <em>string slices</em>,
which are references to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored elsewhere. String
literals, for example, are stored in the program’s binary and are therefore
string slices.</p>
<p>The <code>String</code> type, which is provided by Rust’s standard library rather than
coded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded
string type. When Rustaceans refer to “strings” in Rust, they might be
referring to either the <code>String</code> or the string slice <code>&amp;str</code> types, not just one
of those types. Although this section is largely about <code>String</code>, both types are
used heavily in Rust’s standard library, and both <code>String</code> and string slices
are UTF-8 encoded.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-string"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-string">Creating a New String</a></h3>
<p>Many of the same operations available with <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> are available with <code>String</code>
as well, because <code>String</code> is actually implemented as a wrapper around a vector
of bytes with some extra guarantees, restrictions, and capabilities. An example
of a function that works the same way with <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>String</code> is the <code>new</code>
function to create an instance, shown in Listing 8-11.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-11: Creating a new, empty <code>String</code></span></p>
<p>This line creates a new empty string called <code>s</code>, which we can then load data
into. Often, we’ll have some initial data that we want to start the string
with. For that, we use the <code>to_string</code> method, which is available on any type
that implements the <code>Display</code> trait, as string literals do. Listing 8-12 shows
two examples.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-12: Using the <code>to_string</code> method to create a

<p>We can also use the function <code>String::from</code> to create a <code>String</code> from a string

<p>Often, you’ll want to combine two existing strings. One way to do so is to use
the <code>+</code> operator, as shown in Listing 8-18.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;Hello, &quot;);
    let s2 = String::from(&quot;world!&quot;);
    let s3 = s1 + &amp;s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-18: Using the <code>+</code> operator to combine two
<code>String</code> values into a new <code>String</code> value</span></p>
<p>The string <code>s3</code> will contain <code>Hello, world!</code>. The reason <code>s1</code> is no longer
valid after the addition, and the reason we used a reference to <code>s2</code>, has to do
with the signature of the method that’s called when we use the <code>+</code> operator.
The <code>+</code> operator uses the <code>add</code> method, whose signature looks something like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn add(self, s: &amp;str) -&gt; String {
</code></pre>
<p>In the standard library, you'll see <code>add</code> defined using generics and associated
types. Here, we’ve substituted in concrete types, which is what happens when we
call this method with <code>String</code> values. We’ll discuss generics in Chapter 10.
This signature gives us the clues we need to understand the tricky bits of the
<code>+</code> operator.</p>
<p>First, <code>s2</code> has an <code>&amp;</code>, meaning that we’re adding a <em>reference</em> of the second
string to the first string. This is because of the <code>s</code> parameter in the <code>add</code>
function: we can only add a <code>&amp;str</code> to a <code>String</code>; we can’t add two <code>String</code>
values together. But wait—the type of <code>&amp;s2</code> is <code>&amp;String</code>, not <code>&amp;str</code>, as
specified in the second parameter to <code>add</code>. So why does Listing 8-18 compile?</p>
<p>The reason we’re able to use <code>&amp;s2</code> in the call to <code>add</code> is that the compiler
can <em>coerce</em> the <code>&amp;String</code> argument into a <code>&amp;str</code>. When we call the <code>add</code>
method, Rust uses a <em>deref coercion</em>, which here turns <code>&amp;s2</code> into <code>&amp;s2[..]</code>.
We’ll discuss deref coercion in more depth in Chapter 15. Because <code>add</code> does
not take ownership of the <code>s</code> parameter, <code>s2</code> will still be a valid <code>String</code>
after this operation.</p>
<p>Second, we can see in the signature that <code>add</code> takes ownership of <code>self</code>,
because <code>self</code> does <em>not</em> have an <code>&amp;</code>. This means <code>s1</code> in Listing 8-18 will be
moved into the <code>add</code> call and will no longer be valid after that. So although
<code>let s3 = s1 + &amp;s2;</code> looks like it will copy both strings and create a new one,
this statement actually takes ownership of <code>s1</code>, appends a copy of the contents
of <code>s2</code>, and then returns ownership of the result. In other words, it looks
like it’s making a lot of copies but isn’t; the implementation is more
efficient than copying.</p>
<p>If we need to concatenate multiple strings, the behavior of the <code>+</code> operator
gets unwieldy:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;tic&quot;);
    let s2 = String::from(&quot;tac&quot;);
    let s3 = String::from(&quot;toe&quot;);

    let s = s1 + &quot;-&quot; + &amp;s2 + &quot;-&quot; + &amp;s3;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>At this point, <code>s</code> will be <code>tic-tac-toe</code>. With all of the <code>+</code> and <code>&quot;</code>
characters, it’s difficult to see what’s going on. For more complicated string
combining, we can instead use the <code>format!</code> macro:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    let s1 = String::from(&quot;tic&quot;);
    let s2 = String::from(&quot;tac&quot;);
    let s3 = String::from(&quot;toe&quot;);

    let s = format!(&quot;{}-{}-{}&quot;, s1, s2, s3);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This code also sets <code>s</code> to <code>tic-tac-toe</code>. The <code>format!</code> macro works like
<code>println!</code>, but instead of printing the output to the screen, it returns a
<code>String</code> with the contents. The version of the code using <code>format!</code> is much
easier to read, and the code generated by the <code>format!</code> macro uses references
so that this call doesn’t take ownership of any of its parameters.</p>

<h4 id="internal-representation"><a class="header" href="#internal-representation">Internal Representation</a></h4>
<p>A <code>String</code> is a wrapper over a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>. Let’s look at some of our properly
encoded UTF-8 example strings from Listing 8-14. First, this one:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;السلام عليكم&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;Dobrý den&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;Hello&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;שָׁלוֹם&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;नमस्ते&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;こんにちは&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;안녕하세요&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;你好&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;Olá&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;Здравствуйте&quot;);
</span>    let hello = String::from(&quot;Hola&quot;);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>len</code> will be 4, which means the vector storing the string “Hola”
is 4 bytes long. Each of these letters takes 1 byte when encoded in UTF-8. The
following line, however, may surprise you. (Note that this string begins with
the capital Cyrillic letter Ze, not the Arabic number 3.)</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;السلام عليكم&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;Dobrý den&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;Hello&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;שָׁלוֹם&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;नमस्ते&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;こんにちは&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;안녕하세요&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;你好&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;Olá&quot;);
</span>    let hello = String::from(&quot;Здравствуйте&quot;);
<span class="boring">    let hello = String::from(&quot;Hola&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Asked how long the string is, you might say 12. In fact, Rust’s answer is 24:
that’s the number of bytes it takes to encode “Здравствуйте” in UTF-8, because
each Unicode scalar value in that string takes 2 bytes of storage. Therefore,
an index into the string’s bytes will not always correlate to a valid Unicode
scalar value. To demonstrate, consider this invalid Rust code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">let hello = &quot;Здравствуйте&quot;;
let answer = &amp;hello[0];
</code></pre>
<p>You already know that <code>answer</code> will not be <code>З</code>, the first letter. When encoded
in UTF-8, the first byte of <code>З</code> is <code>208</code> and the second is <code>151</code>, so it would
seem that <code>answer</code> should in fact be <code>208</code>, but <code>208</code> is not a valid character
on its own. Returning <code>208</code> is likely not what a user would want if they asked
for the first letter of this string; however, that’s the only data that Rust
has at byte index 0. Users generally don’t want the byte value returned, even
if the string contains only Latin letters: if <code>&amp;&quot;hello&quot;[0]</code> were valid code
that returned the byte value, it would return <code>104</code>, not <code>h</code>.</p>
<p>The answer, then, is that to avoid returning an unexpected value and causing
bugs that might not be discovered immediately, Rust doesn’t compile this code
at all and prevents misunderstandings early in the development process.</p>
<h4 id="bytes-and-scalar-values-and-grapheme-clusters-oh-my"><a class="header" href="#bytes-and-scalar-values-and-grapheme-clusters-oh-my">Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters! Oh My!</a></h4>
<p>Another point about UTF-8 is that there are actually three relevant ways to
look at strings from Rust’s perspective: as bytes, scalar values, and grapheme
clusters (the closest thing to what we would call <em>letters</em>).</p>
<p>If we look at the Hindi word “नमस्ते” written in the Devanagari script, it is
stored as a vector of <code>u8</code> values that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164,
224, 165, 135]
</code></pre>
<p>That’s 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data. If we look at
them as Unicode scalar values, which are what Rust’s <code>char</code> type is, those
bytes look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">['न', 'म', 'स', '्', 'त', 'े']
</code></pre>
<p>There are six <code>char</code> values here, but the fourth and sixth are not letters:
they’re diacritics that don’t make sense on their own. Finally, if we look at
them as grapheme clusters, we’d get what a person would call the four letters
that make up the Hindi word:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[&quot;न&quot;, &quot;म&quot;, &quot;स्&quot;, &quot;ते&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Rust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data that computers
store so that each program can choose the interpretation it needs, no matter
what human language the data is in.</p>
<p>A final reason Rust doesn’t allow us to index into a <code>String</code> to get a
character is that indexing operations are expected to always take constant time
(O(1)). But it isn’t possible to guarantee that performance with a <code>String</code>,
because Rust would have to walk through the contents from the beginning to the
index to determine how many valid characters there were.</p>
<h3 id="slicing-strings"><a class="header" href="#slicing-strings">Slicing Strings</a></h3>
<p>Indexing into a string is often a bad idea because it’s not clear what the
return type of the string-indexing operation should be: a byte value, a
character, a grapheme cluster, or a string slice. If you really need to use
indices to create string slices, therefore, Rust asks you to be more specific.</p>
<p>Rather than indexing using <code>[]</code> with a single number, you can use <code>[]</code> with a
range to create a string slice containing particular bytes:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let hello = &quot;Здравствуйте&quot;;

let s = &amp;hello[0..4];
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, <code>s</code> will be a <code>&amp;str</code> that contains the first 4 bytes of the string.
Earlier, we mentioned that each of these characters was 2 bytes, which means
<code>s</code> will be <code>Зд</code>.</p>
<p>If we were to try to slice only part of a character’s bytes with something like
<code>&amp;hello[0..1]</code>, Rust would panic at runtime in the same way as if an invalid
index were accessed in a vector:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling collections v0.1.0 (file:///projects/collections)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.43s

note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
</code></pre>
<p>You should use ranges to create string slices with caution, because doing so
can crash your program.</p>
<h3 id="methods-for-iterating-over-strings"><a class="header" href="#methods-for-iterating-over-strings">Methods for Iterating Over Strings</a></h3>
<p>The best way to operate on pieces of strings is to be explicit about whether
you want characters or bytes. For individual Unicode scalar values, use the
<code>chars</code> method. Calling <code>chars</code> on “Зд” separates out and returns two values
of type <code>char</code>, and you can iterate over the result to access each element:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>for c in &quot;Зд&quot;.chars() {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, c);
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This code will print the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">З
д
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, the <code>bytes</code> method returns each raw byte, which might be
appropriate for your domain:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>for b in &quot;Зд&quot;.bytes() {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, b);
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This code will print the four bytes that make up this string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">208
151
208
180
</code></pre>
<p>But be sure to remember that valid Unicode scalar values may be made up of more
than 1 byte.</p>
<p>Getting grapheme clusters from strings as with the Devanagari script is
complex, so this functionality is not provided by the standard library. Crates
are available on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --> if this is the
functionality you need.</p>
<h3 id="strings-are-not-so-simple"><a class="header" href="#strings-are-not-so-simple">Strings Are Not So Simple</a></h3>
<p>To summarize, strings are complicated. Different programming languages make
different choices about how to present this complexity to the programmer. Rust
has chosen to make the correct handling of <code>String</code> data the default behavior
for all Rust programs, which means programmers have to put more thought into
handling UTF-8 data upfront. This trade-off exposes more of the complexity of
strings than is apparent in other programming languages, but it prevents you
from having to handle errors involving non-ASCII characters later in your
development life cycle.</p>
<p>The good news is that the standard library offers a lot of functionality built
off the <code>String</code> and <code>&amp;str</code> types to help handle these complex situations
correctly. Be sure to check out the documentation for useful methods like
<code>contains</code> for searching in a string and <code>replace</code> for substituting parts of a
string with another string.</p>
<p>Let’s switch to something a bit less complex: hash maps!</p>

<p>The last of our common collections is the <em>hash map</em>. The type <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code>
stores a mapping of keys of type <code>K</code> to values of type <code>V</code> using a
<em>hashing function</em>, which determines how it places these keys and values into
memory. Many programming languages support this kind of data structure, but
they often use a different name, such as hash, map, object, hash table,
dictionary, or associative array, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Hash maps are useful when you want to look up data not by using an index, as
you can with vectors, but by using a key that can be of any type. For example,
in a game, you could keep track of each team’s score in a hash map in which
each key is a team’s name and the values are each team’s score. Given a team
name, you can retrieve its score.</p>
<p>We’ll go over the basic API of hash maps in this section, but many more goodies
are hiding in the functions defined on <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> by the standard library.
As always, check the standard library documentation for more information.</p>

handles the <code>Option</code> by calling <code>copied</code> to get an <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> rather than an
<code>Option&lt;&amp;i32&gt;</code>, then <code>unwrap_or</code> to set <code>score</code> to zero if <code>scores</code> doesn't
have an entry for the key.</p>
<p>We can iterate over each key/value pair in a hash map in a similar manner as we
do with vectors, using a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {

    for (key, value) in &amp;scores {
        println!(&quot;{}: {}&quot;, key, value);
    }

<p>For types that implement the <code>Copy</code> trait, like <code>i32</code>, the values are copied
into the hash map. For owned values like <code>String</code>, the values will be moved and

into the hash map. The values that the references point to must be valid for at
least as long as the hash map is valid. We’ll talk more about these issues in

<h3 id="updating-a-hash-map"><a class="header" href="#updating-a-hash-map">Updating a Hash Map</a></h3>
<p>Although the number of key and value pairs is growable, each unique key can
only have one value associated with it at a time (but not vice versa: for
example, both the Blue team and the Yellow team could have value 10 stored in
the <code>scores</code> hash map).</p>
<p>When you want to change the data in a hash map, you have to decide how to
handle the case when a key already has a value assigned. You could replace the
old value with the new value, completely disregarding the old value. You could
keep the old value and ignore the new value, only adding the new value if the
key <em>doesn’t</em> already have a value. Or you could combine the old value and the
new value. Let’s look at how to do each of these!</p>
<h4 id="overwriting-a-value"><a class="header" href="#overwriting-a-value">Overwriting a Value</a></h4>
<p>If we insert a key and a value into a hash map and then insert that same key
with a different value, the value associated with that key will be replaced.
Even though the code in Listing 8-23 calls <code>insert</code> twice, the hash map will
only contain one key/value pair because we’re inserting the value for the Blue
team’s key both times.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {

<p>It’s common to check whether a particular key already exists in the hash map
with a value then take the following actions: if the key does exist in the hash
map, the existing value should remain the way it is. If the key doesn’t exist,
insert it and a value for it.</p>
<p>Hash maps have a special API for this called <code>entry</code> that takes the key you
want to check as a parameter. The return value of the <code>entry</code> method is an enum
called <code>Entry</code> that represents a value that might or might not exist. Let’s say
we want to check whether the key for the Yellow team has a value associated
with it. If it doesn’t, we want to insert the value 50, and the same for the
Blue team. Using the <code>entry</code> API, the code looks like Listing 8-24.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    scores.insert(String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;), 10);

    scores.entry(String::from(&quot;Yellow&quot;)).or_insert(50);
    scores.entry(String::from(&quot;Blue&quot;)).or_insert(50);

<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-24: Using the <code>entry</code> method to only insert if
the key does not already have a value</span></p>
<p>The <code>or_insert</code> method on <code>Entry</code> is defined to return a mutable reference to
the value for the corresponding <code>Entry</code> key if that key exists, and if not,
inserts the parameter as the new value for this key and returns a mutable
reference to the new value. This technique is much cleaner than writing the
logic ourselves and, in addition, plays more nicely with the borrow checker.</p>
<p>Running the code in Listing 8-24 will print <code>{&quot;Yellow&quot;: 50, &quot;Blue&quot;: 10}</code>. The
first call to <code>entry</code> will insert the key for the Yellow team with the value
50 because the Yellow team doesn’t have a value already. The second call to
<code>entry</code> will not change the hash map because the Blue team already has the
value 10.</p>
<h4 id="updating-a-value-based-on-the-old-value"><a class="header" href="#updating-a-value-based-on-the-old-value">Updating a Value Based on the Old Value</a></h4>
<p>Another common use case for hash maps is to look up a key’s value and then
update it based on the old value. For instance, Listing 8-25 shows code that
counts how many times each word appears in some text. We use a hash map with
the words as keys and increment the value to keep track of how many times we’ve
seen that word. If it’s the first time we’ve seen a word, we’ll first insert
the value 0.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let text = &quot;hello world wonderful world&quot;;

    let mut map = HashMap::new();

    for word in text.split_whitespace() {
        let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
        *count += 1;
    }

    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, map);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 8-25: Counting occurrences of words using a hash
map that stores words and counts</span></p>
<p>This code will print <code>{&quot;world&quot;: 2, &quot;hello&quot;: 1, &quot;wonderful&quot;: 1}</code>. You might see
the same key/value pairs printed in a different order: recall from the
<a href="ch08-03-hash-maps.html#accessing-values-in-a-hash-map">“Accessing Values in a Hash Map”</a><!-- ignore --> section that
iterating over a hash map happens in an arbitrary order.</p>
<p>The <code>split_whitespace</code> method returns an iterator over sub-slices, separated by
whitespace, of the value in <code>text</code>. The <code>or_insert</code> method returns a mutable
reference (<code>&amp;mut V</code>) to the value for the specified key. Here we store that
mutable reference in the <code>count</code> variable, so in order to assign to that value,
we must first dereference <code>count</code> using the asterisk (<code>*</code>). The mutable
reference goes out of scope at the end of the <code>for</code> loop, so all of these
changes are safe and allowed by the borrowing rules.</p>
<h3 id="hashing-functions"><a class="header" href="#hashing-functions">Hashing Functions</a></h3>
<p>By default, <code>HashMap</code> uses a hashing function called <em>SipHash</em> that can provide
resistance to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks involving hash
tables<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#siphash">1</a></sup><!-- ignore -->. This is not the fastest hashing algorithm
available, but the trade-off for better security that comes with the drop in
performance is worth it. If you profile your code and find that the default
hash function is too slow for your purposes, you can switch to another function
by specifying a different hasher. A <em>hasher</em> is a type that implements the
<code>BuildHasher</code> trait. We’ll talk about traits and how to implement them in
Chapter 10. You don’t necessarily have to implement your own hasher from

<p>Vectors, strings, and hash maps will provide a large amount of functionality
necessary in programs when you need to store, access, and modify data. Here are
some exercises you should now be equipped to solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the median (when sorted,
the value in the middle position) and mode (the value that occurs most often;
a hash map will be helpful here) of the list.</li>
<li>Convert strings to pig latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to
the end of the word and “ay” is added, so “first” becomes “irst-fay.” Words
that start with a vowel have “hay” added to the end instead (“apple” becomes
“apple-hay”). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!</li>
<li>Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add
employee names to a department in a company. For example, “Add Sally to
Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all
people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted
alphabetically.</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard library API documentation describes methods that vectors, strings,
and hash maps have that will be helpful for these exercises!</p>
<p>We’re getting into more complex programs in which operations can fail, so, it’s
a perfect time to discuss error handling. We’ll do that next!</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="mdbook-quiz/embed.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mdbook-quiz/embed.css"><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="error-handling"><a class="header" href="#error-handling">Error Handling</a></h1>
<p>Errors are a fact of life in software, so Rust has a number of features for
handling situations in which something goes wrong. In many cases, Rust requires
you to acknowledge the possibility of an error and take some action before your
code will compile. This requirement makes your program more robust by ensuring
that you’ll discover errors and handle them appropriately before you’ve
deployed your code to production!</p>
<p>Rust groups errors into two major categories: <em>recoverable</em> and <em>unrecoverable</em>
errors. For a recoverable error, such as a <em>file not found</em> error, we most
likely just want to report the problem to the user and retry the operation.
Unrecoverable errors are always symptoms of bugs, like trying to access a
location beyond the end of an array, and so we want to immediately stop the
program.</p>
<p>Most languages don’t distinguish between these two kinds of errors and handle
both in the same way, using mechanisms such as exceptions. Rust doesn’t have
exceptions. Instead, it has the type <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> for recoverable errors and
the <code>panic!</code> macro that stops execution when the program encounters an
unrecoverable error. This chapter covers calling <code>panic!</code> first and then talks
about returning <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> values. Additionally, we’ll explore
considerations when deciding whether to try to recover from an error or to stop
execution.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="unrecoverable-errors-with-panic"><a class="header" href="#unrecoverable-errors-with-panic">Unrecoverable Errors with <code>panic!</code></a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, bad things happen in your code, and there’s nothing you can do about
it. In these cases, Rust has the <code>panic!</code> macro. There are two ways to cause a
panic in practice: by taking an action that causes our code to panic (such as
accessing an array past the end) or by explicitly calling the <code>panic!</code> macro.
In both cases, we cause a panic in our program. By default, these panics will
print a failure message, unwind, clean up the stack, and quit. Via an
environment variable, you can also have Rust display the call stack when a
panic occurs to make it easier to track down the source of the panic.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="unwinding-the-stack-or-aborting-in-response-to-a-panic"><a class="header" href="#unwinding-the-stack-or-aborting-in-response-to-a-panic">Unwinding the Stack or Aborting in Response to a Panic</a></h3>
<p>By default, when a panic occurs, the program starts <em>unwinding</em>, which
means Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function
it encounters. However, this walking back and cleanup is a lot of work. Rust,
therefore, allows you to choose the alternative of immediately <em>aborting</em>,
which ends the program without cleaning up.</p>
<p>Memory that the program was using will then need to be cleaned
up by the operating system. If in your project you need to make the resulting
binary as small as possible, you can switch from unwinding to aborting upon a
panic by adding <code>panic = 'abort'</code> to the appropriate <code>[profile]</code> sections in
your <em>Cargo.toml</em> file. For example, if you want to abort on panic in release
mode, add this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s try calling <code>panic!</code> in a simple program:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust should_panic panics">fn main() {
    panic!(&quot;crash and burn&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>When you run the program, you’ll see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.25s
     Running `target/debug/panic`
thread 'main' panicked at 'crash and burn', src/main.rs:2:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
</code></pre>
<p>The call to <code>panic!</code> causes the error message contained in the last two lines.
The first line shows our panic message and the place in our source code where
the panic occurred: <em>src/main.rs:2:5</em> indicates that it’s the second line,
fifth character of our <em>src/main.rs</em> file.</p>
<p>In this case, the line indicated is part of our code, and if we go to that
line, we see the <code>panic!</code> macro call. In other cases, the <code>panic!</code> call might
be in code that our code calls, and the filename and line number reported by
the error message will be someone else’s code where the <code>panic!</code> macro is
called, not the line of our code that eventually led to the <code>panic!</code> call. We
can use the backtrace of the functions the <code>panic!</code> call came from to figure
out the part of our code that is causing the problem. We’ll discuss backtraces
in more detail next.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-panic-backtrace"><a class="header" href="#using-a-panic-backtrace">Using a <code>panic!</code> Backtrace</a></h3>
<p>Let’s look at another example to see what it’s like when a <code>panic!</code> call comes
from a library because of a bug in our code instead of from our code calling
the macro directly. Listing 9-1 has some code that attempts to access an
index in a vector beyond the range of valid indexes.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust should_panic panics">fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    v[99];
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-1: Attempting to access an element beyond the
end of a vector, which will cause a call to <code>panic!</code></span></p>
<p>Here, we’re attempting to access the 100th element of our vector (which is at
index 99 because indexing starts at zero), but the vector has only 3 elements.
In this situation, Rust will panic. Using <code>[]</code> is supposed to return an
element, but if you pass an invalid index, there’s no element that Rust could
return here that would be correct.</p>
<p>In C, attempting to read beyond the end of a data structure is undefined
behavior. You might get whatever is at the location in memory that would
correspond to that element in the data structure, even though the memory
doesn’t belong to that structure. This is called a <em>buffer overread</em> and can
lead to security vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to manipulate the index
in such a way as to read data they shouldn’t be allowed to that is stored after
the data structure.</p>
<p>To protect your program from this sort of vulnerability, if you try to read an
element at an index that doesn’t exist, Rust will stop execution and refuse to
continue. Let’s try it and see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run

note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
</code></pre>
<p>This error points at line 4 of our <code>main.rs</code> where we attempt to access index
99. The next note line tells us that we can set the <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code>
environment variable to get a backtrace of exactly what happened to cause the
error. A <em>backtrace</em> is a list of all the functions that have been called to
get to this point. Backtraces in Rust work as they do in other languages: the
key to reading the backtrace is to start from the top and read until you see
files you wrote. That’s the spot where the problem originated. The lines above
that spot are code that your code has called; the lines below are code that
called your code. These before-and-after lines might include core Rust code,
standard library code, or crates that you’re using. Let’s try getting a
backtrace by setting the <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> environment variable to any value
except 0. Listing 9-2 shows output similar to what you’ll see.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of output! The exact output you see might be different depending
on your operating system and Rust version. In order to get backtraces with this
information, debug symbols must be enabled. Debug symbols are enabled by
default when using <code>cargo build</code> or <code>cargo run</code> without the <code>--release</code> flag,

<p>In the output in Listing 9-2, line 6 of the backtrace points to the line in our
project that’s causing the problem: line 4 of <em>src/main.rs</em>. If we don’t want
our program to panic, we should start our investigation at the location pointed
to by the first line mentioning a file we wrote. In Listing 9-1, where we
deliberately wrote code that would panic, the way to fix the panic is to not
request an element beyond the range of the vector indexes. When your code
panics in the future, you’ll need to figure out what action the code is taking
with what values to cause the panic and what the code should do instead.</p>

<p>Most errors aren’t serious enough to require the program to stop entirely.
Sometimes, when a function fails, it’s for a reason that you can easily
interpret and respond to. For example, if you try to open a file and that
operation fails because the file doesn’t exist, you might want to create the
file instead of terminating the process.</p>
<p>Recall from <a href="ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#handling-potential-failure-with-the-result-type">“Handling Potential Failure with the <code>Result</code>
Type”</a><!-- ignore --> in Chapter 2 that the <code>Result</code> enum is
defined as having two variants, <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>, as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>T</code> and <code>E</code> are generic type parameters: we’ll discuss generics in more
detail in Chapter 10. What you need to know right now is that <code>T</code> represents
the type of the value that will be returned in a success case within the <code>Ok</code>
variant, and <code>E</code> represents the type of the error that will be returned in a
failure case within the <code>Err</code> variant. Because <code>Result</code> has these generic type
parameters, we can use the <code>Result</code> type and the functions defined on it in
many different situations where the successful value and error value we want to
return may differ.</p>
<p>Let’s call a function that returns a <code>Result</code> value because the function could
fail. In Listing 9-3 we try to open a file.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-3: Opening a file</span></p>
<p>The return type of <code>File::open</code> is a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. The generic parameter <code>T</code>
has been filled in by the implementation of <code>File::open</code> with the type of the
success value, <code>std::fs::File</code>, which is a file handle. The type of <code>E</code> used in
the error value is <code>std::io::Error</code>. This return type means the call to
<code>File::open</code> might succeed and return a file handle that we can read from or
write to. The function call also might fail: for example, the file might not
exist, or we might not have permission to access the file. The <code>File::open</code>
function needs to have a way to tell us whether it succeeded or failed and at
the same time give us either the file handle or error information. This
information is exactly what the <code>Result</code> enum conveys.</p>
<p>In the case where <code>File::open</code> succeeds, the value in the variable
<code>greeting_file_result</code> will be an instance of <code>Ok</code> that contains a file handle.
In the case where it fails, the value in <code>greeting_file_result</code> will be an
instance of <code>Err</code> that contains more information about the kind of error that
happened.</p>
<p>We need to add to the code in Listing 9-3 to take different actions depending
on the value <code>File::open</code> returns. Listing 9-4 shows one way to handle the
<code>Result</code> using a basic tool, the <code>match</code> expression that we discussed in
Chapter 6.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust should_panic">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;);

    let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
        Ok(file) =&gt; file,
        Err(error) =&gt; panic!(&quot;Problem opening the file: {:?}&quot;, error),
    };
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-4: Using a <code>match</code> expression to handle the
<code>Result</code> variants that might be returned</span></p>
<p>Note that, like the <code>Option</code> enum, the <code>Result</code> enum and its variants have been
brought into scope by the prelude, so we don’t need to specify <code>Result::</code>
before the <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code> variants in the <code>match</code> arms.</p>
<p>When the result is <code>Ok</code>, this code will return the inner <code>file</code> value out of
the <code>Ok</code> variant, and we then assign that file handle value to the variable
<code>greeting_file</code>. After the <code>match</code>, we can use the file handle for reading or
writing.</p>
<p>The other arm of the <code>match</code> handles the case where we get an <code>Err</code> value from
<code>File::open</code>. In this example, we’ve chosen to call the <code>panic!</code> macro. If
there’s no file named <em>hello.txt</em> in our current directory and we run this
code, we’ll see the following output from the <code>panic!</code> macro:</p>

However, we want to take different actions for different failure reasons: if

and return the handle to the new file. If <code>File::open</code> failed for any other
reason—for example, because we didn’t have permission to open the file—we still
want the code to <code>panic!</code> in the same way as it did in Listing 9-4. For this we
add an inner <code>match</code> expression, shown in Listing 9-5.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-5: Handling different kinds of errors in
different ways</span></p>
<p>The type of the value that <code>File::open</code> returns inside the <code>Err</code> variant is
<code>io::Error</code>, which is a struct provided by the standard library. This struct
has a method <code>kind</code> that we can call to get an <code>io::ErrorKind</code> value. The enum
<code>io::ErrorKind</code> is provided by the standard library and has variants
representing the different kinds of errors that might result from an <code>io</code>
operation. The variant we want to use is <code>ErrorKind::NotFound</code>, which indicates
the file we’re trying to open doesn’t exist yet. So we match on
<code>greeting_file_result</code>, but we also have an inner match on <code>error.kind()</code>.</p>
<p>The condition we want to check in the inner match is whether the value returned
by <code>error.kind()</code> is the <code>NotFound</code> variant of the <code>ErrorKind</code> enum. If it is,
we try to create the file with <code>File::create</code>. However, because <code>File::create</code>
could also fail, we need a second arm in the inner <code>match</code> expression. When the
file can’t be created, a different error message is printed. The second arm of
the outer <code>match</code> stays the same, so the program panics on any error besides
the missing file error.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of <code>match</code>! The <code>match</code> expression is very useful but also very
much a primitive. In Chapter 13, you’ll learn about closures, which are used
with many of the methods defined on <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. These methods can be more
concise than using <code>match</code> when handling <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> values in your code.</p>
<p>For example, here’s another way to write the same logic as shown in Listing
9-5, this time using closures and the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> method:</p>
<!-- CAN'T EXTRACT SEE https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/1127 -->
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;).unwrap_or_else(|error| {
        if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound {
            File::create(&quot;hello.txt&quot;).unwrap_or_else(|error| {
                panic!(&quot;Problem creating the file: {:?}&quot;, error);
            })
        } else {
            panic!(&quot;Problem opening the file: {:?}&quot;, error);
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p>Although this code has the same behavior as Listing 9-5, it doesn’t contain
any <code>match</code> expressions and is cleaner to read. Come back to this example
after you’ve read Chapter 13, and look up the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> method in the
standard library documentation. Many more of these methods can clean up huge
nested <code>match</code> expressions when you’re dealing with errors.</p>

<p>Using <code>match</code> works well enough, but it can be a bit verbose and doesn’t always
communicate intent well. The <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type has many helper methods
defined on it to do various, more specific tasks. The <code>unwrap</code> method is a
shortcut method implemented just like the <code>match</code> expression we wrote in
Listing 9-4. If the <code>Result</code> value is the <code>Ok</code> variant, <code>unwrap</code> will return
the value inside the <code>Ok</code>. If the <code>Result</code> is the <code>Err</code> variant, <code>unwrap</code> will
call the <code>panic!</code> macro for us. Here is an example of <code>unwrap</code> in action:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust should_panic">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;).unwrap();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>If we run this code without a <em>hello.txt</em> file, we’ll see an error message from
the <code>panic!</code> call that the <code>unwrap</code> method makes:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch09-error-handling/no-listing-04-unwrap
cargo run
copy and paste relevant text
-->
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os {
code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: &quot;No such file or directory&quot; }',
src/main.rs:4:49
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the <code>expect</code> method lets us also choose the <code>panic!</code> error message.
Using <code>expect</code> instead of <code>unwrap</code> and providing good error messages can convey
your intent and make tracking down the source of a panic easier. The syntax of
<code>expect</code> looks like this:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust should_panic">use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)
        .expect(&quot;hello.txt should be included in this project&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>We use <code>expect</code> in the same way as <code>unwrap</code>: to return the file handle or call
the <code>panic!</code> macro. The error message used by <code>expect</code> in its call to <code>panic!</code>
will be the parameter that we pass to <code>expect</code>, rather than the default
<code>panic!</code> message that <code>unwrap</code> uses. Here’s what it looks like:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch09-error-handling/no-listing-05-expect
cargo run
copy and paste relevant text
-->
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'hello.txt should be included in this project: Os {
code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: &quot;No such file or directory&quot; }',
src/main.rs:5:10
</code></pre>
<p>In production-quality code, most Rustaceans choose <code>expect</code> rather than
<code>unwrap</code> and give more context about why the operation is expected to always
succeed. That way, if your assumptions are ever proven wrong, you have more
information to use in debugging.</p>
<h3 id="propagating-errors"><a class="header" href="#propagating-errors">Propagating Errors</a></h3>
<p>When a function’s implementation calls something that might fail, instead of
handling the error within the function itself, you can return the error to the
calling code so that it can decide what to do. This is known as <em>propagating</em>
the error and gives more control to the calling code, where there might be more
information or logic that dictates how the error should be handled than what
you have available in the context of your code.</p>
<p>For example, Listing 9-6 shows a function that reads a username from a file. If
the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read, this function will return those errors
to the code that called the function.</p>

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-6: A function that returns errors to the
calling code using <code>match</code></span></p>
<p>This function can be written in a much shorter way, but we’re going to start by
doing a lot of it manually in order to explore error handling; at the end,
we’ll show the shorter way. Let’s look at the return type of the function
first: <code>Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt;</code>. This means the function is returning a
value of the type <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> where the generic parameter <code>T</code> has been
filled in with the concrete type <code>String</code>, and the generic type <code>E</code> has been
filled in with the concrete type <code>io::Error</code>.</p>
<p>If this function succeeds without any problems, the code that calls this
function will receive an <code>Ok</code> value that holds a <code>String</code>—the username that
this function read from the file. If this function encounters any problems, the
calling code will receive an <code>Err</code> value that holds an instance of <code>io::Error</code>
that contains more information about what the problems were. We chose
<code>io::Error</code> as the return type of this function because that happens to be the
type of the error value returned from both of the operations we’re calling in
this function’s body that might fail: the <code>File::open</code> function and the
<code>read_to_string</code> method.</p>
<p>The body of the function starts by calling the <code>File::open</code> function. Then we
handle the <code>Result</code> value with a <code>match</code> similar to the <code>match</code> in Listing 9-4.
If <code>File::open</code> succeeds, the file handle in the pattern variable <code>file</code>
becomes the value in the mutable variable <code>username_file</code> and the function
continues. In the <code>Err</code> case, instead of calling <code>panic!</code>, we use the <code>return</code>
keyword to return early out of the function entirely and pass the error value
from <code>File::open</code>, now in the pattern variable <code>e</code>, back to the calling code as
this function’s error value.</p>
<p>So if we have a file handle in <code>username_file</code>, the function then creates a new
<code>String</code> in variable <code>username</code> and calls the <code>read_to_string</code> method on
the file handle in <code>username_file</code> to read the contents of the file into
<code>username</code>. The <code>read_to_string</code> method also returns a <code>Result</code> because it
might fail, even though <code>File::open</code> succeeded. So we need another <code>match</code> to
handle that <code>Result</code>: if <code>read_to_string</code> succeeds, then our function has
succeeded, and we return the username from the file that’s now in <code>username</code>
wrapped in an <code>Ok</code>. If <code>read_to_string</code> fails, we return the error value in the
same way that we returned the error value in the <code>match</code> that handled the
return value of <code>File::open</code>. However, we don’t need to explicitly say
<code>return</code>, because this is the last expression in the function.</p>
<p>The code that calls this code will then handle getting either an <code>Ok</code> value
that contains a username or an <code>Err</code> value that contains an <code>io::Error</code>. It’s
up to the calling code to decide what to do with those values. If the calling
code gets an <code>Err</code> value, it could call <code>panic!</code> and crash the program, use a
default username, or look up the username from somewhere other than a file, for
example. We don’t have enough information on what the calling code is actually
trying to do, so we propagate all the success or error information upward for
it to handle appropriately.</p>
<p>This pattern of propagating errors is so common in Rust that Rust provides the
question mark operator <code>?</code> to make this easier.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-7: A function that returns errors to the

<p>The <code>?</code> placed after a <code>Result</code> value is defined to work in almost the same way
as the <code>match</code> expressions we defined to handle the <code>Result</code> values in Listing
9-6. If the value of the <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code>, the value inside the <code>Ok</code> will
get returned from this expression, and the program will continue. If the value
is an <code>Err</code>, the <code>Err</code> will be returned from the whole function as if we had
used the <code>return</code> keyword so the error value gets propagated to the calling
code.</p>
<p>There is a difference between what the <code>match</code> expression from Listing 9-6 does
and what the <code>?</code> operator does: error values that have the <code>?</code> operator called
on them go through the <code>from</code> function, defined in the <code>From</code> trait in the
standard library, which is used to convert values from one type into another.
When the <code>?</code> operator calls the <code>from</code> function, the error type received is
converted into the error type defined in the return type of the current
function. This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent
all the ways a function might fail, even if parts might fail for many different
reasons.</p>
<p>For example, we could change the <code>read_username_from_file</code> function in Listing
9-7 to return a custom error type named <code>OurError</code> that we define. If we also
define <code>impl From&lt;io::Error&gt; for OurError</code> to construct an instance of
<code>OurError</code> from an <code>io::Error</code>, then the <code>?</code> operator calls in the body of
<code>read_username_from_file</code> will call <code>from</code> and convert the error types without
needing to add any more code to the function.</p>
<p>In the context of Listing 9-7, the <code>?</code> at the end of the <code>File::open</code> call will
return the value inside an <code>Ok</code> to the variable <code>username_file</code>. If an error
occurs, the <code>?</code> operator will return early out of the whole function and give
any <code>Err</code> value to the calling code. The same thing applies to the <code>?</code> at the
end of the <code>read_to_string</code> call.</p>
<p>The <code>?</code> operator eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes this function’s
implementation simpler. We could even shorten this code further by chaining
method calls immediately after the <code>?</code>, as shown in Listing 9-8.</p>

<p>Reading a file into a string is a fairly common operation, so the standard
library provides the convenient <code>fs::read_to_string</code> function that opens the
file, creates a new <code>String</code>, reads the contents of the file, puts the contents
into that <code>String</code>, and returns it. Of course, using <code>fs::read_to_string</code>

<h4 id="where-the--operator-can-be-used"><a class="header" href="#where-the--operator-can-be-used">Where The <code>?</code> Operator Can Be Used</a></h4>
<p>The <code>?</code> operator can only be used in functions whose return type is compatible
with the value the <code>?</code> is used on. This is because the <code>?</code> operator is defined
to perform an early return of a value out of the function, in the same manner
as the <code>match</code> expression we defined in Listing 9-6. In Listing 9-6, the
<code>match</code> was using a <code>Result</code> value, and the early return arm returned an
<code>Err(e)</code> value. The return type of the function has to be a <code>Result</code> so that
it’s compatible with this <code>return</code>.</p>
<p>In Listing 9-10, let’s look at the error we’ll get if we use the <code>?</code> operator
in a <code>main</code> function with a return type incompatible with the type of the value
we use <code>?</code> on:</p>

<p>This error points out that we’re only allowed to use the <code>?</code> operator in a
function that returns <code>Result</code>, <code>Option</code>, or another type that implements
<code>FromResidual</code>.</p>
<p>To fix the error, you have two choices. One choice is to change the return type
of your function to be compatible with the value you’re using the <code>?</code> operator
on as long as you have no restrictions preventing that. The other technique is
to use a <code>match</code> or one of the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> methods to handle the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> in whatever way is appropriate.</p>
<p>The error message also mentioned that <code>?</code> can be used with <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> values
as well. As with using <code>?</code> on <code>Result</code>, you can only use <code>?</code> on <code>Option</code> in a
function that returns an <code>Option</code>. The behavior of the <code>?</code> operator when called
on an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is similar to its behavior when called on a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>:
if the value is <code>None</code>, the <code>None</code> will be returned early from the function at
that point. If the value is <code>Some</code>, the value inside the <code>Some</code> is the
resulting value of the expression and the function continues. Listing 9-11 has
an example of a function that finds the last character of the first line in the
given text:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn last_char_of_first_line(text: &amp;str) -&gt; Option&lt;char&gt; {

<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-11: Using the <code>?</code> operator on an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>
value</span></p>
<p>This function returns <code>Option&lt;char&gt;</code> because it’s possible that there is a
character there, but it’s also possible that there isn’t. This code takes the
<code>text</code> string slice argument and calls the <code>lines</code> method on it, which returns
an iterator over the lines in the string. Because this function wants to
examine the first line, it calls <code>next</code> on the iterator to get the first value
from the iterator. If <code>text</code> is the empty string, this call to <code>next</code> will
return <code>None</code>, in which case we use <code>?</code> to stop and return <code>None</code> from
<code>last_char_of_first_line</code>. If <code>text</code> is not the empty string, <code>next</code> will
return a <code>Some</code> value containing a string slice of the first line in <code>text</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>?</code> extracts the string slice, and we can call <code>chars</code> on that string slice
to get an iterator of its characters. We’re interested in the last character in
this first line, so we call <code>last</code> to return the last item in the iterator.
This is an <code>Option</code> because it’s possible that the first line is the empty
string, for example if <code>text</code> starts with a blank line but has characters on
other lines, as in <code>&quot;\nhi&quot;</code>. However, if there is a last character on the first
line, it will be returned in the <code>Some</code> variant. The <code>?</code> operator in the middle
gives us a concise way to express this logic, allowing us to implement the
function in one line. If we couldn’t use the <code>?</code> operator on <code>Option</code>, we’d
have to implement this logic using more method calls or a <code>match</code> expression.</p>
<p>Note that you can use the <code>?</code> operator on a <code>Result</code> in a function that returns
<code>Result</code>, and you can use the <code>?</code> operator on an <code>Option</code> in a function that
returns <code>Option</code>, but you can’t mix and match. The <code>?</code> operator won’t
automatically convert a <code>Result</code> to an <code>Option</code> or vice versa; in those cases,
you can use methods like the <code>ok</code> method on <code>Result</code> or the <code>ok_or</code> method on
<code>Option</code> to do the conversion explicitly.</p>
<p>So far, all the <code>main</code> functions we’ve used return <code>()</code>. The <code>main</code> function is
special because it’s the entry and exit point of executable programs, and there
are restrictions on what its return type can be for the programs to behave as
expected.</p>
<p>Luckily, <code>main</code> can also return a <code>Result&lt;(), E&gt;</code>. Listing 9-12 has the
code from Listing 9-10 but we’ve changed the return type of <code>main</code> to be
<code>Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt;</code> and added a return value <code>Ok(())</code> to the end. This
code will now compile:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {
    let greeting_file = File::open(&quot;hello.txt&quot;)?;

    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 9-12: Changing <code>main</code> to return <code>Result&lt;(), E&gt;</code>
allows the use of the <code>?</code> operator on <code>Result</code> values</span></p>
<p>The <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> type is a <em>trait object</em>, which we’ll talk about in the
<a href="ch17-02-trait-objects.html#using-trait-objects-that-allow-for-values-of-different-types">“Using Trait Objects that Allow for Values of Different
Types”</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 17. For now, you can
read <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> to mean “any kind of error.” Using <code>?</code> on a <code>Result</code>
value in a <code>main</code> function with the error type <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> is allowed,
because it allows any <code>Err</code> value to be returned early. Even though the body of
this <code>main</code> function will only ever return errors of type <code>std::io::Error</code>, by
specifying <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code>, this signature will continue to be correct even if
more code that returns other errors is added to the body of <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>When a <code>main</code> function returns a <code>Result&lt;(), E&gt;</code>, the executable will
exit with a value of <code>0</code> if <code>main</code> returns <code>Ok(())</code> and will exit with a
nonzero value if <code>main</code> returns an <code>Err</code> value. Executables written in C return
integers when they exit: programs that exit successfully return the integer
<code>0</code>, and programs that error return some integer other than <code>0</code>. Rust also
returns integers from executables to be compatible with this convention.</p>
<p>The <code>main</code> function may return any types that implement <a href="../std/process/trait.Termination.html">the
<code>std::process::Termination</code> trait</a><!-- ignore -->, which contains
a function <code>report</code> that returns an <code>ExitCode</code> Consult the standard library
documentation for more information on implementing the <code>Termination</code> trait for
your own types.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed the details of calling <code>panic!</code> or returning <code>Result</code>,

<p>So how do you decide when you should call <code>panic!</code> and when you should return
<code>Result</code>? When code panics, there’s no way to recover. You could call <code>panic!</code>
for any error situation, whether there’s a possible way to recover or not, but
then you’re making the decision that a situation is unrecoverable on behalf of
the calling code. When you choose to return a <code>Result</code> value, you give the
calling code options. The calling code could choose to attempt to recover in a
way that’s appropriate for its situation, or it could decide that an <code>Err</code>
value in this case is unrecoverable, so it can call <code>panic!</code> and turn your
recoverable error into an unrecoverable one. Therefore, returning <code>Result</code> is a
good default choice when you’re defining a function that might fail.</p>
<p>In situations such as examples, prototype code, and tests, it’s more
appropriate to write code that panics instead of returning a <code>Result</code>. Let’s
explore why, then discuss situations in which the compiler can’t tell that
failure is impossible, but you as a human can. The chapter will conclude with
some general guidelines on how to decide whether to panic in library code.</p>
<h3 id="examples-prototype-code-and-tests"><a class="header" href="#examples-prototype-code-and-tests">Examples, Prototype Code, and Tests</a></h3>
<p>When you’re writing an example to illustrate some concept, also including robust
error-handling code can make the example less clear. In
examples, it’s understood that a call to a method like <code>unwrap</code> that could
panic is meant as a placeholder for the way you’d want your application to
handle errors, which can differ based on what the rest of your code is doing.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <code>unwrap</code> and <code>expect</code> methods are very handy when prototyping,
before you’re ready to decide how to handle errors. They leave clear markers in
your code for when you’re ready to make your program more robust.</p>
<p>If a method call fails in a test, you’d want the whole test to fail, even if
that method isn’t the functionality under test. Because <code>panic!</code> is how a test
is marked as a failure, calling <code>unwrap</code> or <code>expect</code> is exactly what should
happen.</p>
<h3 id="cases-in-which-you-have-more-information-than-the-compiler"><a class="header" href="#cases-in-which-you-have-more-information-than-the-compiler">Cases in Which You Have More Information Than the Compiler</a></h3>
<p>It would also be appropriate to call <code>unwrap</code> or <code>expect</code> when you have some
other logic that ensures the <code>Result</code> will have an <code>Ok</code> value, but the logic
isn’t something the compiler understands. You’ll still have a <code>Result</code> value
that you need to handle: whatever operation you’re calling still has the
possibility of failing in general, even though it’s logically impossible in
your particular situation. If you can ensure by manually inspecting the code
that you’ll never have an <code>Err</code> variant, it’s perfectly acceptable to call
<code>unwrap</code>, and even better to document the reason you think you’ll never have an
<code>Err</code> variant in the <code>expect</code> text. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>    use std::net::IpAddr;

    let home: IpAddr = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
        .parse()
        .expect(&quot;Hardcoded IP address should be valid&quot;);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We’re creating an <code>IpAddr</code> instance by parsing a hardcoded string. We can see
that <code>127.0.0.1</code> is a valid IP address, so it’s acceptable to use <code>expect</code>
here. However, having a hardcoded, valid string doesn’t change the return type
of the <code>parse</code> method: we still get a <code>Result</code> value, and the compiler will
still make us handle the <code>Result</code> as if the <code>Err</code> variant is a possibility
because the compiler isn’t smart enough to see that this string is always a
valid IP address. If the IP address string came from a user rather than being
hardcoded into the program and therefore <em>did</em> have a possibility of failure,
we’d definitely want to handle the <code>Result</code> in a more robust way instead.
Mentioning the assumption that this IP address is hardcoded will prompt us to
change <code>expect</code> to better error handling code if in the future, we need to get
the IP address from some other source instead.</p>
<h3 id="guidelines-for-error-handling"><a class="header" href="#guidelines-for-error-handling">Guidelines for Error Handling</a></h3>
<p>It’s advisable to have your code panic when it’s possible that your code
could end up in a bad state. In this context, a <em>bad state</em> is when some
assumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when
invalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your
code—plus one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to something that
will likely happen occasionally, like a user entering data in the wrong
format.</li>
<li>Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state,
rather than checking for the problem at every step.</li>
<li>There’s not a good way to encode this information in the types you use. We’ll
work through an example of what we mean in the <a href="ch17-03-oo-design-patterns.html#encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types">“Encoding States and Behavior
as Types”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 17.</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone calls your code and passes in values that don’t make sense, it’s
best to return an error if you can so the user of the library can decide what
they want to do in that case. However, in cases where continuing could be
insecure or harmful, the best choice might be to call <code>panic!</code> and alert the
person using your library to the bug in their code so they can fix it during
development. Similarly, <code>panic!</code> is often appropriate if you’re calling
external code that is out of your control and it returns an invalid state that
you have no way of fixing.</p>
<p>However, when failure is expected, it’s more appropriate to return a <code>Result</code>
than to make a <code>panic!</code> call. Examples include a parser being given malformed
data or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate
limit. In these cases, returning a <code>Result</code> indicates that failure is an
expected possibility that the calling code must decide how to handle.</p>
<p>When your code performs an operation that could put a user at risk if it’s
called using invalid values, your code should verify the values are valid first
and panic if the values aren’t valid. This is mostly for safety reasons:
attempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code to vulnerabilities.
This is the main reason the standard library will call <code>panic!</code> if you attempt
an out-of-bounds memory access: trying to access memory that doesn’t belong to
the current data structure is a common security problem. Functions often have
<em>contracts</em>: their behavior is only guaranteed if the inputs meet particular
requirements. Panicking when the contract is violated makes sense because a
contract violation always indicates a caller-side bug and it’s not a kind of
error you want the calling code to have to explicitly handle. In fact, there’s
no reasonable way for calling code to recover; the calling <em>programmers</em> need
to fix the code. Contracts for a function, especially when a violation will
cause a panic, should be explained in the API documentation for the function.</p>
<p>However, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose
and annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust’s type system (and thus the type
checking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks for you. If your
function has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code’s
logic knowing that the compiler has already ensured you have a valid value. For
example, if you have a type rather than an <code>Option</code>, your program expects to
have <em>something</em> rather than <em>nothing</em>. Your code then doesn’t have to handle
two cases for the <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code> variants: it will only have one case for
definitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing to your function won’t
even compile, so your function doesn’t have to check for that case at runtime.
Another example is using an unsigned integer type such as <code>u32</code>, which ensures
the parameter is never negative.</p>
<h3 id="creating-custom-types-for-validation"><a class="header" href="#creating-custom-types-for-validation">Creating Custom Types for Validation</a></h3>
<p>Let’s take the idea of using Rust’s type system to ensure we have a valid value
one step further and look at creating a custom type for validation. Recall the
guessing game in Chapter 2 in which our code asked the user to guess a number
between 1 and 100. We never validated that the user’s guess was between those
numbers before checking it against our secret number; we only validated that
the guess was positive. In this case, the consequences were not very dire: our
output of “Too high” or “Too low” would still be correct. But it would be a
useful enhancement to guide the user toward valid guesses and have different
behavior when a user guesses a number that’s out of range versus when a user
types, for example, letters instead.</p>
<p>One way to do this would be to parse the guess as an <code>i32</code> instead of only a
<code>u32</code> to allow potentially negative numbers, and then add a check for the
number being in range, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use rand::Rng;

        };

        if guess &lt; 1 || guess &gt; 100 {

</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>if</code> expression checks whether our value is out of range, tells the user
about the problem, and calls <code>continue</code> to start the next iteration of the loop
and ask for another guess. After the <code>if</code> expression, we can proceed with the
comparisons between <code>guess</code> and the secret number knowing that <code>guess</code> is
between 1 and 100.</p>
<p>However, this is not an ideal solution: if it was absolutely critical that the
program only operated on values between 1 and 100, and it had many functions
with this requirement, having a check like this in every function would be
tedious (and might impact performance).</p>
<p>Instead, we can make a new type and put the validations in a function to create
an instance of the type rather than repeating the validations everywhere. That
way, it’s safe for functions to use the new type in their signatures and
confidently use the values they receive. Listing 9-13 shows one way to define a
<code>Guess</code> type that will only create an instance of <code>Guess</code> if the <code>new</code> function
receives a value between 1 and 100.</p>

<code>value</code> does pass the test, we create a new <code>Guess</code> with its <code>value</code> field set
to the <code>value</code> parameter and return the <code>Guess</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we implement a method named <code>value</code> that borrows <code>self</code>, doesn’t have any
other parameters, and returns an <code>i32</code>. This kind of method is sometimes called
a <em>getter</em>, because its purpose is to get some data from its fields and return
it. This public method is necessary because the <code>value</code> field of the <code>Guess</code>
struct is private. It’s important that the <code>value</code> field be private so code
using the <code>Guess</code> struct is not allowed to set <code>value</code> directly: code outside
the module <em>must</em> use the <code>Guess::new</code> function to create an instance of
<code>Guess</code>, thereby ensuring there’s no way for a <code>Guess</code> to have a <code>value</code> that
hasn’t been checked by the conditions in the <code>Guess::new</code> function.</p>
<p>A function that has a parameter or returns only numbers between 1 and 100 could
then declare in its signature that it takes or returns a <code>Guess</code> rather than an
<code>i32</code> and wouldn’t need to do any additional checks in its body.</p>

<p>Rust’s error handling features are designed to help you write more robust code.
The <code>panic!</code> macro signals that your program is in a state it can’t handle and
lets you tell the process to stop instead of trying to proceed with invalid or
incorrect values. The <code>Result</code> enum uses Rust’s type system to indicate that
operations might fail in a way that your code could recover from. You can use
<code>Result</code> to tell code that calls your code that it needs to handle potential
success or failure as well. Using <code>panic!</code> and <code>Result</code> in the appropriate
situations will make your code more reliable in the face of inevitable problems.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen useful ways that the standard library uses generics with
the <code>Option</code> and <code>Result</code> enums, we’ll talk about how generics work and how you
can use them in your code.</p>

<p>Every programming language has tools for effectively handling the duplication
of concepts. In Rust, one such tool is <em>generics</em>: abstract stand-ins for
concrete types or other properties. We can express the behavior of generics or
how they relate to other generics without knowing what will be in their place
when compiling and running the code.</p>
<p>Functions can take parameters of some generic type, instead of a concrete type
like <code>i32</code> or <code>String</code>, in the same way a function takes parameters with
unknown values to run the same code on multiple concrete values. In fact, we’ve
already used generics in Chapter 6 with <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, Chapter 8 with <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>
and <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code>, and Chapter 9 with <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. In this chapter, you’ll
explore how to define your own types, functions, and methods with generics!</p>
<p>First, we’ll review how to extract a function to reduce code duplication. We’ll
then use the same technique to make a generic function from two functions that
differ only in the types of their parameters. We’ll also explain how to use
generic types in struct and enum definitions.</p>
<p>Then you’ll learn how to use <em>traits</em> to define behavior in a generic way. You
can combine traits with generic types to constrain a generic type to accept
only those types that have a particular behavior, as opposed to just any type.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll discuss <em>lifetimes</em>: a variety of generics that give the
compiler information about how references relate to each other. Lifetimes allow
us to give the compiler enough information about borrowed values so that it can
ensure references will be valid in more situations than it could without our
help.</p>
<h2 id="removing-duplication-by-extracting-a-function"><a class="header" href="#removing-duplication-by-extracting-a-function">Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function</a></h2>
<p>Generics allow us to replace specific types with a placeholder that represents
multiple types to remove code duplication. Before diving into generics syntax,
then, let’s first look at how to remove duplication in a way that doesn’t
involve generic types by extracting a function that replaces specific values
with a placeholder that represents multiple values. Then we’ll apply the same
technique to extract a generic function! By looking at how to recognize
duplicated code you can extract into a function, you’ll start to recognize
duplicated code that can use generics.</p>
<p>We begin with the short program in Listing 10-1 that finds the largest number
in a list.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = &amp;number_list[0];

    for number in &amp;number_list {
        if number &gt; largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, largest);
<span class="boring">    assert_eq!(*largest, 100);
</span>}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-1: Finding the largest number in a list of
numbers</span></p>
<p>We store a list of integers in the variable <code>number_list</code> and place a reference
to the first number in the list in a variable named <code>largest</code>. We then iterate
through all the numbers in the list, and if the current number is greater than
the number stored in <code>largest</code>, replace the reference in that variable.
However, if the current number is less than or equal to the largest number seen
so far, the variable doesn’t change, and the code moves on to the next number
in the list. After considering all the numbers in the list, <code>largest</code> should
refer to the largest number, which in this case is 100.</p>
<p>We've now been tasked with finding the largest number in two different lists of
numbers. To do so, we can choose to duplicate the code in Listing 10-1 and use
the same logic at two different places in the program, as shown in Listing 10-2.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = &amp;number_list[0];

    for number in &amp;number_list {
        if number &gt; largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, largest);

    let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

    let mut largest = &amp;number_list[0];

    for number in &amp;number_list {
        if number &gt; largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, largest);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-2: Code to find the largest number in <em>two</em>
lists of numbers</span></p>
<p>Although this code works, duplicating code is tedious and error prone. We also
have to remember to update the code in multiple places when we want to change
it.</p>
<p>To eliminate this duplication, we’ll create an abstraction by defining a
function that operates on any list of integers passed in a parameter. This
solution makes our code clearer and lets us express the concept of finding the
largest number in a list abstractly.</p>
<p>In Listing 10-3, we extract the code that finds the largest number into a
function named <code>largest</code>. Then we call the function to find the largest number
in the two lists from Listing 10-2. We could also use the function on any other
list of <code>i32</code> values we might have in the future.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn largest(list: &amp;[i32]) -&gt; &amp;i32 {

            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];

    let result = largest(&amp;number_list);
    println!(&quot;The largest number is {}&quot;, result);
<span class="boring">    assert_eq!(*result, 6000);
</span>}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-3: Abstracted code to find the largest number
in two lists</span></p>
<p>The <code>largest</code> function has a parameter called <code>list</code>, which represents any
concrete slice of <code>i32</code> values we might pass into the function. As a result,
when we call the function, the code runs on the specific values that we pass
in.</p>
<p>In summary, here are the steps we took to change the code from Listing 10-2 to
Listing 10-3:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify duplicate code.</li>
<li>Extract the duplicate code into the body of the function and specify the
inputs and return values of that code in the function signature.</li>
<li>Update the two instances of duplicated code to call the function instead.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, we’ll use these same steps with generics to reduce code duplication. In
the same way that the function body can operate on an abstract <code>list</code> instead
of specific values, generics allow code to operate on abstract types.</p>
<p>For example, say we had two functions: one that finds the largest item in a
slice of <code>i32</code> values and one that finds the largest item in a slice of <code>char</code>
values. How would we eliminate that duplication? Let’s find out!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="generic-data-types"><a class="header" href="#generic-data-types">Generic Data Types</a></h2>
<p>We use generics to create definitions for items like function signatures or
structs, which we can then use with many different concrete data types. Let’s
first look at how to define functions, structs, enums, and methods using
generics. Then we’ll discuss how generics affect code performance.</p>
<h3 id="in-function-definitions"><a class="header" href="#in-function-definitions">In Function Definitions</a></h3>
<p>When defining a function that uses generics, we place the generics in the
signature of the function where we would usually specify the data types of the
parameters and return value. Doing so makes our code more flexible and provides
more functionality to callers of our function while preventing code duplication.</p>
<p>Continuing with our <code>largest</code> function, Listing 10-4 shows two functions that
both find the largest value in a slice. We'll then combine these into a single
function that uses generics.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-4: Two functions that differ only in their
names and the types in their signatures</span></p>
<p>The <code>largest_i32</code> function is the one we extracted in Listing 10-3 that finds
the largest <code>i32</code> in a slice. The <code>largest_char</code> function finds the largest
<code>char</code> in a slice. The function bodies have the same code, so let’s eliminate
the duplication by introducing a generic type parameter in a single function.</p>
<p>To parameterize the types in a new single function, we need to name the type
parameter, just as we do for the value parameters to a function. You can use
any identifier as a type parameter name. But we’ll use <code>T</code> because, by
convention, type parameter names in Rust are short, often just a letter, and Rust’s
type-naming convention is CamelCase. Short for “type,” <code>T</code> is the default
choice of most Rust programmers.</p>
<p>When we use a parameter in the body of the function, we have to declare the
parameter name in the signature so the compiler knows what that name means.
Similarly, when we use a type parameter name in a function signature, we have
to declare the type parameter name before we use it. To define the generic
<code>largest</code> function, place type name declarations inside angle brackets, <code>&lt;&gt;</code>,
between the name of the function and the parameter list, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn largest&lt;T&gt;(list: &amp;[T]) -&gt; &amp;T {
</code></pre>
<p>We read this definition as: the function <code>largest</code> is generic over some type
<code>T</code>. This function has one parameter named <code>list</code>, which is a slice of values
of type <code>T</code>. The <code>largest</code> function will return a reference to a value of the
same type <code>T</code>.</p>
<p>Listing 10-5 shows the combined <code>largest</code> function definition using the generic
data type in its signature. The listing also shows how we can call the function
with either a slice of <code>i32</code> values or <code>char</code> values. Note that this code won’t
compile yet, but we’ll fix it later in this chapter.</p>

<p>The help text mentions <code>std::cmp::PartialOrd</code>, which is a <em>trait</em>, and we’re
going to talk about traits in the next section. For now, know that this error
states that the body of <code>largest</code> won’t work for all possible types that <code>T</code>
could be. Because we want to compare values of type <code>T</code> in the body, we can
only use types whose values can be ordered. To enable comparisons, the standard
library has the <code>std::cmp::PartialOrd</code> trait that you can implement on types
(see Appendix C for more on this trait). By following the help text's
suggestion, we restrict the types valid for <code>T</code> to only those that implement
<code>PartialOrd</code> and this example will compile, because the standard library
implements <code>PartialOrd</code> on both <code>i32</code> and <code>char</code>.</p>
<h3 id="in-struct-definitions"><a class="header" href="#in-struct-definitions">In Struct Definitions</a></h3>
<p>We can also define structs to use a generic type parameter in one or more
fields using the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> syntax. Listing 10-6 defines a <code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code> struct to hold
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinate values of any type.</p>

<p>Note that because we’ve used only one generic type to define <code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code>, this
definition says that the <code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code> struct is generic over some type <code>T</code>, and
the fields <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are <em>both</em> that same type, whatever that type may be. If

<p>To define a <code>Point</code> struct where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are both generics but could have
different types, we can use multiple generic type parameters. For example, in
Listing 10-8, we change the definition of <code>Point</code> to be generic over types <code>T</code>
and <code>U</code> where <code>x</code> is of type <code>T</code> and <code>y</code> is of type <code>U</code>.</p>

<p>Now all the instances of <code>Point</code> shown are allowed! You can use as many generic
type parameters in a definition as you want, but using more than a few makes
your code hard to read. If you're finding you need lots of generic types in
your code, it could indicate that your code needs restructuring into smaller
pieces.</p>
<h3 id="in-enum-definitions"><a class="header" href="#in-enum-definitions">In Enum Definitions</a></h3>
<p>As we did with structs, we can define enums to hold generic data types in their
variants. Let’s take another look at the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum that the standard
library provides, which we used in Chapter 6:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Option&lt;T&gt; {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This definition should now make more sense to you. As you can see, the
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum is generic over type <code>T</code> and has two variants: <code>Some</code>, which
holds one value of type <code>T</code>, and a <code>None</code> variant that doesn’t hold any value.
By using the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum, we can express the abstract concept of an
optional value, and because <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is generic, we can use this abstraction
no matter what the type of the optional value is.</p>
<p>Enums can use multiple generic types as well. The definition of the <code>Result</code>
enum that we used in Chapter 9 is one example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>Result</code> enum is generic over two types, <code>T</code> and <code>E</code>, and has two variants:
<code>Ok</code>, which holds a value of type <code>T</code>, and <code>Err</code>, which holds a value of type
<code>E</code>. This definition makes it convenient to use the <code>Result</code> enum anywhere we
have an operation that might succeed (return a value of some type <code>T</code>) or fail
(return an error of some type <code>E</code>). In fact, this is what we used to open a
file in Listing 9-3, where <code>T</code> was filled in with the type <code>std::fs::File</code> when
the file was opened successfully and <code>E</code> was filled in with the type
<code>std::io::Error</code> when there were problems opening the file.</p>
<p>When you recognize situations in your code with multiple struct or enum
definitions that differ only in the types of the values they hold, you can
avoid duplication by using generic types instead.</p>
<h3 id="in-method-definitions"><a class="header" href="#in-method-definitions">In Method Definitions</a></h3>
<p>We can implement methods on structs and enums (as we did in Chapter 5) and use
generic types in their definitions, too. Listing 10-9 shows the <code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code>
struct we defined in Listing 10-6 with a method named <code>x</code> implemented on it.</p>

<code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code> struct that will return a reference to the <code>x</code> field of type
<code>T</code></span></p>
<p>Here, we’ve defined a method named <code>x</code> on <code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code> that returns a reference
to the data in the field <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Note that we have to declare <code>T</code> just after <code>impl</code> so we can use <code>T</code> to specify
that we’re implementing methods on the type <code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code>. By declaring <code>T</code> as a
generic type after <code>impl</code>, Rust can identify that the type in the angle
brackets in <code>Point</code> is a generic type rather than a concrete type. We could
have chosen a different name for this generic parameter than the generic
parameter declared in the struct definition, but using the same name is
conventional. Methods written within an <code>impl</code> that declares the generic type
will be defined on any instance of the type, no matter what concrete type ends
up substituting for the generic type.</p>
<p>We can also specify constraints on generic types when defining methods on the
type. We could, for example, implement methods only on <code>Point&lt;f32&gt;</code> instances
rather than on <code>Point&lt;T&gt;</code> instances with any generic type. In Listing 10-10 we
use the concrete type <code>f32</code>, meaning we don’t declare any types after <code>impl</code>.</p>

<p>In <code>main</code>, we’ve defined a <code>Point</code> that has an <code>i32</code> for <code>x</code> (with value <code>5</code>)
and an <code>f64</code> for <code>y</code> (with value <code>10.4</code>). The <code>p2</code> variable is a <code>Point</code> struct
that has a string slice for <code>x</code> (with value <code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code>) and a <code>char</code> for <code>y</code>
(with value <code>c</code>). Calling <code>mixup</code> on <code>p1</code> with the argument <code>p2</code> gives us <code>p3</code>,
which will have an <code>i32</code> for <code>x</code>, because <code>x</code> came from <code>p1</code>. The <code>p3</code> variable
will have a <code>char</code> for <code>y</code>, because <code>y</code> came from <code>p2</code>. The <code>println!</code> macro

<p>The purpose of this example is to demonstrate a situation in which some generic

definition. Here, the generic parameters <code>X1</code> and <code>Y1</code> are declared after

<h3 id="performance-of-code-using-generics"><a class="header" href="#performance-of-code-using-generics">Performance of Code Using Generics</a></h3>
<p>You might be wondering whether there is a runtime cost when using generic type
parameters. The good news is that using generic types won't make your program run 
any slower than it would with concrete types.</p>
<p>Rust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code using
generics at compile time. <em>Monomorphization</em> is the process of turning generic
code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when
compiled. In this process, the compiler does the opposite of the steps we used
to create the generic function in Listing 10-5: the compiler looks at all the
places where generic code is called and generates code for the concrete types
the generic code is called with.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how this works by using the standard library’s generic
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let integer = Some(5);
let float = Some(5.0);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>When Rust compiles this code, it performs monomorphization. During that
process, the compiler reads the values that have been used in <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>
instances and identifies two kinds of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>: one is <code>i32</code> and the other
is <code>f64</code>. As such, it expands the generic definition of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> into two
definitions specialized to <code>i32</code> and <code>f64</code>, thereby replacing the generic
definition with the specific ones.</p>
<p>The monomorphized version of the code looks similar to the following (the
compiler uses different names than what we’re using here for illustration):</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">enum Option_i32 {
    Some(i32),
    None,
}

enum Option_f64 {
    Some(f64),
    None,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Option_i32::Some(5);
    let float = Option_f64::Some(5.0);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The generic <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is replaced with the specific definitions created by
the compiler. Because Rust compiles generic code into code that specifies the
type in each instance, we pay no runtime cost for using generics. When the code
runs, it performs just as it would if we had duplicated each definition by
hand. The process of monomorphization makes Rust’s generics extremely efficient
at runtime.</p>

<p>A <em>trait</em> defines functionality a particular type has and can share with other
types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We can
use <em>trait bounds</em> to specify that a generic type can be any type that has
certain behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called <em>interfaces</em> in other
languages, although with some differences.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="defining-a-trait"><a class="header" href="#defining-a-trait">Defining a Trait</a></h3>
<p>A type’s behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type. Different
types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those
types. Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to
define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds and
amounts of text: a <code>NewsArticle</code> struct that holds a news story filed in a
particular location and a <code>Tweet</code> that can have at most 280 characters along
with metadata that indicates whether it was a new tweet, a retweet, or a reply
to another tweet.</p>
<p>We want to make a media aggregator library crate named <code>aggregator</code> that can
display summaries of data that might be stored in a <code>NewsArticle</code> or <code>Tweet</code>
instance. To do this, we need a summary from each type, and we’ll request
that summary by calling a <code>summarize</code> method on an instance. Listing 10-12
shows the definition of a public <code>Summary</code> trait that expresses this behavior.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String;
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-12: A <code>Summary</code> trait that consists of the
behavior provided by a <code>summarize</code> method</span></p>
<p>Here, we declare a trait using the <code>trait</code> keyword and then the trait’s name,
which is <code>Summary</code> in this case. We’ve also declared the trait as <code>pub</code> so that
crates depending on this crate can make use of this trait too, as we’ll see in
a few examples. Inside the curly brackets, we declare the method signatures
that describe the behaviors of the types that implement this trait, which in
this case is <code>fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String</code>.</p>
<p>After the method signature, instead of providing an implementation within curly
brackets, we use a semicolon. Each type implementing this trait must provide
its own custom behavior for the body of the method. The compiler will enforce
that any type that has the <code>Summary</code> trait will have the method <code>summarize</code>
defined with this signature exactly.</p>
<p>A trait can have multiple methods in its body: the method signatures are listed
one per line and each line ends in a semicolon.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-a-trait-on-a-type"><a class="header" href="#implementing-a-trait-on-a-type">Implementing a Trait on a Type</a></h3>
<p>Now that we’ve defined the desired signatures of the <code>Summary</code> trait’s methods,
we can implement it on the types in our media aggregator. Listing 10-13 shows
an implementation of the <code>Summary</code> trait on the <code>NewsArticle</code> struct that uses
the headline, the author, and the location to create the return value of
<code>summarize</code>. For the <code>Tweet</code> struct, we define <code>summarize</code> as the username
followed by the entire text of the tweet, assuming that tweet content is
already limited to 280 characters.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>

    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        format!(&quot;{}, by {} ({})&quot;, self.headline, self.author, self.location)
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        format!(&quot;{}: {}&quot;, self.username, self.content)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-13: Implementing the <code>Summary</code> trait on the
<code>NewsArticle</code> and <code>Tweet</code> types</span></p>
<p>Implementing a trait on a type is similar to implementing regular methods. The
difference is that after <code>impl</code>, we put the trait name we want to implement,
then use the <code>for</code> keyword, and then specify the name of the type we want to
implement the trait for. Within the <code>impl</code> block, we put the method signatures
that the trait definition has defined. Instead of adding a semicolon after each
signature, we use curly brackets and fill in the method body with the specific
behavior that we want the methods of the trait to have for the particular type.</p>
<p>Now that the library has implemented the <code>Summary</code> trait on <code>NewsArticle</code> and
<code>Tweet</code>, users of the crate can call the trait methods on instances of
<code>NewsArticle</code> and <code>Tweet</code> in the same way we call regular methods. The only
difference is that the user must bring the trait into scope as well as the
types. Here’s an example of how a binary crate could use our <code>aggregator</code>
library crate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use aggregator::{Summary, Tweet};

fn main() {
    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from(&quot;horse_ebooks&quot;),
        content: String::from(
            &quot;of course, as you probably already know, people&quot;,
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!(&quot;1 new tweet: {}&quot;, tweet.summarize());
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code prints <code>1 new tweet: horse_ebooks: of course, as you probably already know, people</code>.</p>
<p>Other crates that depend on the <code>aggregator</code> crate can also bring the <code>Summary</code>
trait into scope to implement <code>Summary</code> on their own types. One restriction to
note is that we can implement a trait on a type only if at least one of the
trait or the type is local to our crate. For example, we can implement standard
library traits like <code>Display</code> on a custom type like <code>Tweet</code> as part of our
<code>aggregator</code> crate functionality, because the type <code>Tweet</code> is local to our
<code>aggregator</code> crate. We can also implement <code>Summary</code> on <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> in our
<code>aggregator</code> crate, because the trait <code>Summary</code> is local to our <code>aggregator</code>
crate.</p>
<p>But we can’t implement external traits on external types. For example, we can’t
implement the <code>Display</code> trait on <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> within our <code>aggregator</code> crate,
because <code>Display</code> and <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> are both defined in the standard library and
aren’t local to our <code>aggregator</code> crate. This restriction is part of a property
called <em>coherence</em>, and more specifically the <em>orphan rule</em>, so named because
the parent type is not present. This rule ensures that other people’s code
can’t break your code and vice versa. Without the rule, two crates could
implement the same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn’t know which
implementation to use.</p>
<h3 id="default-implementations"><a class="header" href="#default-implementations">Default Implementations</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes it’s useful to have default behavior for some or all of the methods
in a trait instead of requiring implementations for all methods on every type.
Then, as we implement the trait on a particular type, we can keep or override
each method’s default behavior.</p>
<p>In Listing 10-14 we specify a default string for the <code>summarize</code> method of the
<code>Summary</code> trait instead of only defining the method signature, as we did in
Listing 10-12.</p>

<p>To use a default implementation to summarize instances of <code>NewsArticle</code>, we
specify an empty <code>impl</code> block with <code>impl Summary for NewsArticle {}</code>.</p>
<p>Even though we’re no longer defining the <code>summarize</code> method on <code>NewsArticle</code>
directly, we’ve provided a default implementation and specified that
<code>NewsArticle</code> implements the <code>Summary</code> trait. As a result, we can still call
the <code>summarize</code> method on an instance of <code>NewsArticle</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">use aggregator::{self, NewsArticle, Summary};
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

<p>This code prints <code>New article available! (Read more...)</code>.</p>
<p>Creating a default implementation doesn’t require us to change anything about
the implementation of <code>Summary</code> on <code>Tweet</code> in Listing 10-13. The reason is that
the syntax for overriding a default implementation is the same as the syntax
for implementing a trait method that doesn’t have a default implementation.</p>
<p>Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even if those
other methods don’t have a default implementation. In this way, a trait can
provide a lot of useful functionality and only require implementors to specify
a small part of it. For example, we could define the <code>Summary</code> trait to have a
<code>summarize_author</code> method whose implementation is required, and then define a
<code>summarize</code> method that has a default implementation that calls the
<code>summarize_author</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize_author(&amp;self) -&gt; String;

</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>To use this version of <code>Summary</code>, we only need to define <code>summarize_author</code>

<p>Now that you know how to define and implement traits, we can explore how to use
traits to define functions that accept many different types. We'll use the
<code>Summary</code> trait we implemented on the <code>NewsArticle</code> and <code>Tweet</code> types in
Listing 10-13 to define a <code>notify</code> function that calls the <code>summarize</code> method
on its <code>item</code> parameter, which is of some type that implements the <code>Summary</code>
trait. To do this, we use the <code>impl Trait</code> syntax, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">pub trait Summary {
</span><span class="boring">    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String;
</span><span class="boring">}

</code></pre>
<p>Instead of a concrete type for the <code>item</code> parameter, we specify the <code>impl</code>
keyword and the trait name. This parameter accepts any type that implements the
specified trait. In the body of <code>notify</code>, we can call any methods on <code>item</code>
that come from the <code>Summary</code> trait, such as <code>summarize</code>. We can call <code>notify</code>
and pass in any instance of <code>NewsArticle</code> or <code>Tweet</code>. Code that calls the
function with any other type, such as a <code>String</code> or an <code>i32</code>, won’t compile
because those types don’t implement <code>Summary</code>.</p>

<p><a id="fixing-the-largest-function-with-trait-bounds"></a></p>
<h4 id="trait-bound-syntax"><a class="header" href="#trait-bound-syntax">Trait Bound Syntax</a></h4>
<p>The <code>impl Trait</code> syntax works for straightforward cases but is actually syntax
sugar for a longer form known as a <em>trait bound</em>; it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn notify&lt;T: Summary&gt;(item: &amp;T) {
    println!(&quot;Breaking news! {}&quot;, item.summarize());
}
</code></pre>
<p>This longer form is equivalent to the example in the previous section but is
more verbose. We place trait bounds with the declaration of the generic type
parameter after a colon and inside angle brackets.</p>
<p>The <code>impl Trait</code> syntax is convenient and makes for more concise code in simple
cases, while the fuller trait bound syntax can express more complexity in other
cases. For example, we can have two parameters that implement <code>Summary</code>. Doing
so with the <code>impl Trait</code> syntax looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn notify(item1: &amp;impl Summary, item2: &amp;impl Summary) {
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>impl Trait</code> is appropriate if we want this function to allow <code>item1</code> and
<code>item2</code> to have different types (as long as both types implement <code>Summary</code>). If
we want to force both parameters to have the same type, however, we must use a
trait bound, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn notify&lt;T: Summary&gt;(item1: &amp;T, item2: &amp;T) {
</code></pre>
<p>The generic type <code>T</code> specified as the type of the <code>item1</code> and <code>item2</code>
parameters constrains the function such that the concrete type of the value
passed as an argument for <code>item1</code> and <code>item2</code> must be the same.</p>
<h4 id="specifying-multiple-trait-bounds-with-the--syntax"><a class="header" href="#specifying-multiple-trait-bounds-with-the--syntax">Specifying Multiple Trait Bounds with the <code>+</code> Syntax</a></h4>
<p>We can also specify more than one trait bound. Say we wanted <code>notify</code> to use
display formatting as well as <code>summarize</code> on <code>item</code>: we specify in the <code>notify</code>
definition that <code>item</code> must implement both <code>Display</code> and <code>Summary</code>. We can do
so using the <code>+</code> syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn notify(item: &amp;(impl Summary + Display)) {
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>+</code> syntax is also valid with trait bounds on generic types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn notify&lt;T: Summary + Display&gt;(item: &amp;T) {
</code></pre>
<p>With the two trait bounds specified, the body of <code>notify</code> can call <code>summarize</code>
and use <code>{}</code> to format <code>item</code>.</p>
<h4 id="clearer-trait-bounds-with-where-clauses"><a class="header" href="#clearer-trait-bounds-with-where-clauses">Clearer Trait Bounds with <code>where</code> Clauses</a></h4>
<p>Using too many trait bounds has its downsides. Each generic has its own trait
bounds, so functions with multiple generic type parameters can contain lots of
trait bound information between the function’s name and its parameter list,
making the function signature hard to read. For this reason, Rust has alternate
syntax for specifying trait bounds inside a <code>where</code> clause after the function
signature. So instead of writing this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn some_function&lt;T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug&gt;(t: &amp;T, u: &amp;U) -&gt; i32 {
</code></pre>
<p>we can use a <code>where</code> clause, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn some_function&lt;T, U&gt;(t: &amp;T, u: &amp;U) -&gt; i32
where
    T: Display + Clone,
    U: Clone + Debug,
{
<span class="boring">    unimplemented!()
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This function’s signature is less cluttered: the function name, parameter list,
and return type are close together, similar to a function without lots of trait
bounds.</p>
<h3 id="returning-types-that-implement-traits"><a class="header" href="#returning-types-that-implement-traits">Returning Types that Implement Traits</a></h3>
<p>We can also use the <code>impl Trait</code> syntax in the return position to return a
value of some type that implements a trait, as shown here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore"><span class="boring">pub trait Summary {
</span><span class="boring">    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String;

        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>By using <code>impl Summary</code> for the return type, we specify that the
<code>returns_summarizable</code> function returns some type that implements the <code>Summary</code>
trait without naming the concrete type. In this case, <code>returns_summarizable</code>
returns a <code>Tweet</code>, but the code calling this function doesn’t need to know that.</p>
<p>The ability to specify a return type only by the trait it implements is
especially useful in the context of closures and iterators, which we cover in
Chapter 13. Closures and iterators create types that only the compiler knows or
types that are very long to specify. The <code>impl Trait</code> syntax lets you concisely
specify that a function returns some type that implements the <code>Iterator</code> trait
without needing to write out a very long type.</p>
<p>However, you can only use <code>impl Trait</code> if you’re returning a single type. For
example, this code that returns either a <code>NewsArticle</code> or a <code>Tweet</code> with the
return type specified as <code>impl Summary</code> wouldn’t work:</p>

<p>Returning either a <code>NewsArticle</code> or a <code>Tweet</code> isn’t allowed due to restrictions
around how the <code>impl Trait</code> syntax is implemented in the compiler. We’ll cover
how to write a function with this behavior in the <a href="ch17-02-trait-objects.html#using-trait-objects-that-allow-for-values-of-different-types">“Using Trait Objects That

<h3 id="using-trait-bounds-to-conditionally-implement-methods"><a class="header" href="#using-trait-bounds-to-conditionally-implement-methods">Using Trait Bounds to Conditionally Implement Methods</a></h3>
<p>By using a trait bound with an <code>impl</code> block that uses generic type parameters,
we can implement methods conditionally for types that implement the specified
traits. For example, the type <code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code> in Listing 10-15 always implements the
<code>new</code> function to return a new instance of <code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code> (recall from the
<a href="ch05-03-method-syntax.html#defining-methods">“Defining Methods”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 5 that <code>Self</code>
is a type alias for the type of the <code>impl</code> block, which in this case is
<code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code>). But in the next <code>impl</code> block, <code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code> only implements the
<code>cmp_display</code> method if its inner type <code>T</code> implements the <code>PartialOrd</code> trait
that enables comparison <em>and</em> the <code>Display</code> trait that enables printing.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">use std::fmt::Display;

struct Pair&lt;T&gt; {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl&lt;T&gt; Pair&lt;T&gt; {
    fn new(x: T, y: T) -&gt; Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }
}

impl&lt;T: Display + PartialOrd&gt; Pair&lt;T&gt; {
    fn cmp_display(&amp;self) {
        if self.x &gt;= self.y {
            println!(&quot;The largest member is x = {}&quot;, self.x);
        } else {
            println!(&quot;The largest member is y = {}&quot;, self.y);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-15: Conditionally implementing methods on a
generic type depending on trait bounds</span></p>
<p>We can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that implements
another trait. Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait
bounds are called <em>blanket implementations</em> and are extensively used in the
Rust standard library. For example, the standard library implements the
<code>ToString</code> trait on any type that implements the <code>Display</code> trait. The <code>impl</code>
block in the standard library looks similar to this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;T: Display&gt; ToString for T {
    // --snip--
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because the standard library has this blanket implementation, we can call the
<code>to_string</code> method defined by the <code>ToString</code> trait on any type that implements
the <code>Display</code> trait. For example, we can turn integers into their corresponding
<code>String</code> values like this because integers implement <code>Display</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s = 3.to_string();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Blanket implementations appear in the documentation for the trait in the
“Implementors” section.</p>
<p>Traits and trait bounds let us write code that uses generic type parameters to
reduce duplication but also specify to the compiler that we want the generic
type to have particular behavior. The compiler can then use the trait bound
information to check that all the concrete types used with our code provide the
correct behavior. In dynamically typed languages, we would get an error at
runtime if we called a method on a type which didn’t define the method. But Rust
moves these errors to compile time so we’re forced to fix the problems before
our code is even able to run. Additionally, we don’t have to write code that
checks for behavior at runtime because we’ve already checked at compile time.
Doing so improves performance without having to give up the flexibility of
generics.</p>

<p>Lifetimes are another kind of generic that we’ve already been using. Rather
than ensuring that a type has the behavior we want, lifetimes ensure that
references are valid as long as we need them to be.</p>
<p>One detail we didn’t discuss in the <a href="ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#references-and-borrowing">“References and
Borrowing”</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 4 is
that every reference in Rust has a <em>lifetime</em>, which is the scope for which
that reference is valid. Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred,
just like most of the time, types are inferred. We only must annotate types
when multiple types are possible. In a similar way, we must annotate lifetimes
when the lifetimes of references could be related in a few different ways. Rust
requires us to annotate the relationships using generic lifetime parameters to
ensure the actual references used at runtime will definitely be valid.</p>
<p>Annotating lifetimes is not even a concept most other programming languages
have, so this is going to feel unfamiliar. Although we won’t cover lifetimes in
their entirety in this chapter, we’ll discuss common ways you might encounter
lifetime syntax so you can get comfortable with the concept.</p>
<h3 id="preventing-dangling-references-with-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#preventing-dangling-references-with-lifetimes">Preventing Dangling References with Lifetimes</a></h3>
<p>The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent <em>dangling references</em>, which cause a

scope.</p>

<p>Note: The examples in Listings 10-16, 10-17, and 10-23 declare variables

the inner scope ends, and we attempt to print the value in <code>r</code>. This code won’t

</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>x</code> doesn’t “live long enough.” The reason is that <code>x</code> will be out
of scope when the inner scope ends on line 7. But <code>r</code> is still valid for the
outer scope; because its scope is larger, we say that it “lives longer.” If
Rust allowed this code to work, <code>r</code> would be referencing memory that was
deallocated when <code>x</code> went out of scope, and anything we tried to do with <code>r</code>
wouldn’t work correctly. So how does Rust determine that this code is invalid?
It uses a borrow checker.</p>

<p>Here, we’ve annotated the lifetime of <code>r</code> with <code>'a</code> and the lifetime of <code>x</code>
with <code>'b</code>. As you can see, the inner <code>'b</code> block is much smaller than the outer
<code>'a</code> lifetime block. At compile time, Rust compares the size of the two
lifetimes and sees that <code>r</code> has a lifetime of <code>'a</code> but that it refers to memory
with a lifetime of <code>'b</code>. The program is rejected because <code>'b</code> is shorter than
<code>'a</code>: the subject of the reference doesn’t live as long as the reference.</p>
<p>Listing 10-18 fixes the code so it doesn’t have a dangling reference and
compiles without any errors.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-18: A valid reference because the data has a
longer lifetime than the reference</span></p>
<p>Here, <code>x</code> has the lifetime <code>'b</code>, which in this case is larger than <code>'a</code>. This
means <code>r</code> can reference <code>x</code> because Rust knows that the reference in <code>r</code> will
always be valid while <code>x</code> is valid.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The help text reveals that the return type needs a generic lifetime parameter
on it because Rust can’t tell whether the reference being returned refers to
<code>x</code> or <code>y</code>. Actually, we don’t know either, because the <code>if</code> block in the body
of this function returns a reference to <code>x</code> and the <code>else</code> block returns a
reference to <code>y</code>!</p>
<p>When we’re defining this function, we don’t know the concrete values that will
be passed into this function, so we don’t know whether the <code>if</code> case or the
<code>else</code> case will execute. We also don’t know the concrete lifetimes of the
references that will be passed in, so we can’t look at the scopes as we did in
Listings 10-17 and 10-18 to determine whether the reference we return will
always be valid. The borrow checker can’t determine this either, because it
doesn’t know how the lifetimes of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> relate to the lifetime of the
return value. To fix this error, we’ll add generic lifetime parameters that
define the relationship between the references so the borrow checker can
perform its analysis.</p>
<h3 id="lifetime-annotation-syntax"><a class="header" href="#lifetime-annotation-syntax">Lifetime Annotation Syntax</a></h3>
<p>Lifetime annotations don’t change how long any of the references live. Rather,
they describe the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each
other without affecting the lifetimes. Just as functions can accept any type
when the signature specifies a generic type parameter, functions can accept
references with any lifetime by specifying a generic lifetime parameter.</p>
<p>Lifetime annotations have a slightly unusual syntax: the names of lifetime
parameters must start with an apostrophe (<code>'</code>) and are usually all lowercase
and very short, like generic types. Most people use the name <code>'a</code> for the first
lifetime annotation. We place lifetime parameter annotations after the <code>&amp;</code> of a
reference, using a space to separate the annotation from the reference’s type.</p>
<p>Here are some examples: a reference to an <code>i32</code> without a lifetime parameter, a
reference to an <code>i32</code> that has a lifetime parameter named <code>'a</code>, and a mutable
reference to an <code>i32</code> that also has the lifetime <code>'a</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">&amp;i32        // a reference
&amp;'a i32     // a reference with an explicit lifetime
&amp;'a mut i32 // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime
</code></pre>
<p>One lifetime annotation by itself doesn’t have much meaning, because the
annotations are meant to tell Rust how generic lifetime parameters of multiple
references relate to each other. Let’s examine how the lifetime annotations
relate to each other in the context of the <code>longest</code> function.</p>
<h3 id="lifetime-annotations-in-function-signatures"><a class="header" href="#lifetime-annotations-in-function-signatures">Lifetime Annotations in Function Signatures</a></h3>
<p>To use lifetime annotations in function signatures, we need to declare the
generic <em>lifetime</em> parameters inside angle brackets between the function name
and the parameter list, just as we did with generic <em>type</em> parameters.</p>
<p>We want the signature to express the following constraint: the returned
reference will be valid as long as both the parameters are valid. This is the
relationship between lifetimes of the parameters and the return value. We’ll
name the lifetime <code>'a</code> and then add it to each reference, as shown in Listing
10-21.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 10-21: The <code>longest</code> function definition
specifying that all the references in the signature must have the same lifetime
<code>'a</code></span></p>
<p>This code should compile and produce the result we want when we use it with the
<code>main</code> function in Listing 10-19.</p>
<p>The function signature now tells Rust that for some lifetime <code>'a</code>, the function
takes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at least as
long as lifetime <code>'a</code>. The function signature also tells Rust that the string
slice returned from the function will live at least as long as lifetime <code>'a</code>.
In practice, it means that the lifetime of the reference returned by the
<code>longest</code> function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the values
referred to by the function arguments. These relationships are what we want
Rust to use when analyzing this code.</p>
<p>Remember, when we specify the lifetime parameters in this function signature,
we’re not changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned. Rather,
we’re specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don’t
adhere to these constraints. Note that the <code>longest</code> function doesn’t need to
know exactly how long <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will live, only that some scope can be
substituted for <code>'a</code> that will satisfy this signature.</p>
<p>When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the function
signature, not in the function body. The lifetime annotations become part of
the contract of the function, much like the types in the signature. Having
function signatures contain the lifetime contract means the analysis the Rust
compiler does can be simpler. If there’s a problem with the way a function is
annotated or the way it is called, the compiler errors can point to the part of
our code and the constraints more precisely. If, instead, the Rust compiler
made more inferences about what we intended the relationships of the lifetimes
to be, the compiler might only be able to point to a use of our code many steps
away from the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>When we pass concrete references to <code>longest</code>, the concrete lifetime that is
substituted for <code>'a</code> is the part of the scope of <code>x</code> that overlaps with the
scope of <code>y</code>. In other words, the generic lifetime <code>'a</code> will get the concrete
lifetime that is equal to the smaller of the lifetimes of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. Because
we’ve annotated the returned reference with the same lifetime parameter <code>'a</code>,
the returned reference will also be valid for the length of the smaller of the
lifetimes of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how the lifetime annotations restrict the <code>longest</code> function by
passing in references that have different concrete lifetimes. Listing 10-22 is
a straightforward example.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The error shows that for <code>result</code> to be valid for the <code>println!</code> statement,
<code>string2</code> would need to be valid until the end of the outer scope. Rust knows
this because we annotated the lifetimes of the function parameters and return
values using the same lifetime parameter <code>'a</code>.</p>
<p>As humans, we can look at this code and see that <code>string1</code> is longer than
<code>string2</code> and therefore <code>result</code> will contain a reference to <code>string1</code>.
Because <code>string1</code> has not gone out of scope yet, a reference to <code>string1</code> will
still be valid for the <code>println!</code> statement. However, the compiler can’t see
that the reference is valid in this case. We’ve told Rust that the lifetime of
the reference returned by the <code>longest</code> function is the same as the smaller of
the lifetimes of the references passed in. Therefore, the borrow checker
disallows the code in Listing 10-23 as possibly having an invalid reference.</p>
<p>Try designing more experiments that vary the values and lifetimes of the
references passed in to the <code>longest</code> function and how the returned reference
is used. Make hypotheses about whether or not your experiments will pass the
borrow checker before you compile; then check to see if you’re right!</p>

<p>The way in which you need to specify lifetime parameters depends on what your

<p>We’ve specified a lifetime parameter <code>'a</code> for the parameter <code>x</code> and the return
type, but not for the parameter <code>y</code>, because the lifetime of <code>y</code> does not have
any relationship with the lifetime of <code>x</code> or the return value.</p>
<p>When returning a reference from a function, the lifetime parameter for the
return type needs to match the lifetime parameter for one of the parameters. If
the reference returned does <em>not</em> refer to one of the parameters, it must refer
to a value created within this function. However, this would be a dangling
reference because the value will go out of scope at the end of the function.
Consider this attempted implementation of the <code>longest</code> function that won’t

<p>Here, even though we’ve specified a lifetime parameter <code>'a</code> for the return

<p>The problem is that <code>result</code> goes out of scope and gets cleaned up at the end
of the <code>longest</code> function. We’re also trying to return a reference to <code>result</code>
from the function. There is no way we can specify lifetime parameters that
would change the dangling reference, and Rust won’t let us create a dangling
reference. In this case, the best fix would be to return an owned data type
rather than a reference so the calling function is then responsible for
cleaning up the value.</p>
<p>Ultimately, lifetime syntax is about connecting the lifetimes of various
parameters and return values of functions. Once they’re connected, Rust has
enough information to allow memory-safe operations and disallow operations that
would create dangling pointers or otherwise violate memory safety.</p>

it holds in its <code>part</code> field.</p>
<p>The <code>main</code> function here creates an instance of the <code>ImportantExcerpt</code> struct
that holds a reference to the first sentence of the <code>String</code> owned by the

compiled without lifetime annotations, even though the parameter and return
type are references</span></p>
<p>The reason this function compiles without lifetime annotations is historical:
in early versions (pre-1.0) of Rust, this code wouldn’t have compiled because
every reference needed an explicit lifetime. At that time, the function
signature would have been written like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
</code></pre>
<p>After writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust programmers
were entering the same lifetime annotations over and over in particular
situations. These situations were predictable and followed a few deterministic
patterns. The developers programmed these patterns into the compiler’s code so
the borrow checker could infer the lifetimes in these situations and wouldn’t
need explicit annotations.</p>
<p>This piece of Rust history is relevant because it’s possible that more
deterministic patterns will emerge and be added to the compiler. In the future,
even fewer lifetime annotations might be required.</p>
<p>The patterns programmed into Rust’s analysis of references are called the
<em>lifetime elision rules</em>. These aren’t rules for programmers to follow; they’re
a set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if your code
fits these cases, you don’t need to write the lifetimes explicitly.</p>
<p>The elision rules don’t provide full inference. If Rust deterministically
applies the rules but there is still ambiguity as to what lifetimes the
references have, the compiler won’t guess what the lifetime of the remaining
references should be. Instead of guessing, the compiler will give you an error
that you can resolve by adding the lifetime annotations.</p>
<p>Lifetimes on function or method parameters are called <em>input lifetimes</em>, and
lifetimes on return values are called <em>output lifetimes</em>.</p>
<p>The compiler uses three rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references
when there aren’t explicit annotations. The first rule applies to input
lifetimes, and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes. If the
compiler gets to the end of the three rules and there are still references for
which it can’t figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error.
These rules apply to <code>fn</code> definitions as well as <code>impl</code> blocks.</p>
<p>The first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each
parameter that’s a reference. In other words, a function with one parameter gets
one lifetime parameter: <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32)</code>; a function with two
parameters gets two separate lifetime parameters: <code>fn foo&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32, y: &amp;'b i32)</code>; and so on.</p>
<p>The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that
lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32) -&gt; &amp;'a i32</code>.</p>
<p>The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but
one of them is <code>&amp;self</code> or <code>&amp;mut self</code> because this is a method, the lifetime of
<code>self</code> is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third rule makes
methods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are necessary.</p>
<p>Let’s pretend we’re the compiler. We’ll apply these rules to figure out the
lifetimes of the references in the signature of the <code>first_word</code> function in
Listing 10-25. The signature starts without any lifetimes associated with the
references:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word(s: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>Then the compiler applies the first rule, which specifies that each parameter
gets its own lifetime. We’ll call it <code>'a</code> as usual, so now the signature is
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>The second rule applies because there is exactly one input lifetime. The second
rule specifies that the lifetime of the one input parameter gets assigned to
the output lifetime, so the signature is now this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {
</code></pre>
<p>Now all the references in this function signature have lifetimes, and the
compiler can continue its analysis without needing the programmer to annotate
the lifetimes in this function signature.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another example, this time using the <code>longest</code> function that had
no lifetime parameters when we started working with it in Listing 10-20:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn longest(x: &amp;str, y: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s apply the first rule: each parameter gets its own lifetime. This time we
have two parameters instead of one, so we have two lifetimes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn longest&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;'b str) -&gt; &amp;str {
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the second rule doesn’t apply because there is more than one
input lifetime. The third rule doesn’t apply either, because <code>longest</code> is a
function rather than a method, so none of the parameters are <code>self</code>. After
working through all three rules, we still haven’t figured out what the return
type’s lifetime is. This is why we got an error trying to compile the code in
Listing 10-20: the compiler worked through the lifetime elision rules but still
couldn’t figure out all the lifetimes of the references in the signature.</p>
<p>Because the third rule really only applies in method signatures, we’ll look at
lifetimes in that context next to see why the third rule means we don’t have to
annotate lifetimes in method signatures very often.</p>
<h3 id="lifetime-annotations-in-method-definitions"><a class="header" href="#lifetime-annotations-in-method-definitions">Lifetime Annotations in Method Definitions</a></h3>
<p>When we implement methods on a struct with lifetimes, we use the same syntax as
that of generic type parameters shown in Listing 10-11. Where we declare and
use the lifetime parameters depends on whether they’re related to the struct
fields or the method parameters and return values.</p>
<p>Lifetime names for struct fields always need to be declared after the <code>impl</code>
keyword and then used after the struct’s name, because those lifetimes are part
of the struct’s type.</p>
<p>In method signatures inside the <code>impl</code> block, references might be tied to the
lifetime of references in the struct’s fields, or they might be independent. In
addition, the lifetime elision rules often make it so that lifetime annotations
aren’t necessary in method signatures. Let’s look at some examples using the
struct named <code>ImportantExcerpt</code> that we defined in Listing 10-24.</p>
<p>First, we’ll use a method named <code>level</code> whose only parameter is a reference to
<code>self</code> and whose return value is an <code>i32</code>, which is not a reference to anything:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">struct ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {

</span><span class="boring">        part: first_sentence,
</span><span class="boring">    };
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The lifetime parameter declaration after <code>impl</code> and its use after the type name
are required, but we’re not required to annotate the lifetime of the reference
to <code>self</code> because of the first elision rule.</p>
<p>Here is an example where the third lifetime elision rule applies:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">struct ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {

        self.part

</span><span class="boring">    };
</span><span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>There are two input lifetimes, so Rust applies the first lifetime elision rule
and gives both <code>&amp;self</code> and <code>announcement</code> their own lifetimes. Then, because
one of the parameters is <code>&amp;self</code>, the return type gets the lifetime of <code>&amp;self</code>,
and all lifetimes have been accounted for.</p>
<h3 id="the-static-lifetime"><a class="header" href="#the-static-lifetime">The Static Lifetime</a></h3>
<p>One special lifetime we need to discuss is <code>'static</code>, which denotes that the
affected reference <em>can</em> live for the entire duration of the program. All
string literals have the <code>'static</code> lifetime, which we can annotate as follows:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>let s: &amp;'static str = &quot;I have a static lifetime.&quot;;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The text of this string is stored directly in the program’s binary, which
is always available. Therefore, the lifetime of all string literals is
<code>'static</code>.</p>
<p>You might see suggestions to use the <code>'static</code> lifetime in error messages. But
before specifying <code>'static</code> as the lifetime for a reference, think about
whether the reference you have actually lives the entire lifetime of your
program or not, and whether you want it to. Most of the time, an error message
suggesting the <code>'static</code> lifetime results from attempting to create a dangling
reference or a mismatch of the available lifetimes. In such cases, the solution
is fixing those problems, not specifying the <code>'static</code> lifetime.</p>
<h2 id="generic-type-parameters-trait-bounds-and-lifetimes-together"><a class="header" href="#generic-type-parameters-trait-bounds-and-lifetimes-together">Generic Type Parameters, Trait Bounds, and Lifetimes Together</a></h2>
<p>Let’s briefly look at the syntax of specifying generic type parameters, trait
bounds, and lifetimes all in one function!</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span><span class="boring">    let string1 = String::from(&quot;abcd&quot;);
</span><span class="boring">    let string2 = &quot;xyz&quot;;
</span><span class="boring">
</span><span class="boring">    let result = longest_with_an_announcement(
</span><span class="boring">        string1.as_str(),
</span><span class="boring">        string2,
</span><span class="boring">        &quot;Today is someone's birthday!&quot;,
</span><span class="boring">    );
</span><span class="boring">    println!(&quot;The longest string is {}&quot;, result);
</span><span class="boring">}
</span><span class="boring">
</span>use std::fmt::Display;

fn longest_with_an_announcement&lt;'a, T&gt;(
    x: &amp;'a str,
    y: &amp;'a str,
    ann: T,
) -&gt; &amp;'a str
where
    T: Display,
{
    println!(&quot;Announcement! {}&quot;, ann);
    if x.len() &gt; y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>This is the <code>longest</code> function from Listing 10-21 that returns the longer of
two string slices. But now it has an extra parameter named <code>ann</code> of the generic
type <code>T</code>, which can be filled in by any type that implements the <code>Display</code>
trait as specified by the <code>where</code> clause. This extra parameter will be printed
using <code>{}</code>, which is why the <code>Display</code> trait bound is necessary. Because
lifetimes are a type of generic, the declarations of the lifetime parameter
<code>'a</code> and the generic type parameter <code>T</code> go in the same list inside the angle
brackets after the function name.</p>

<h2 id="summary-9"><a class="header" href="#summary-9">Summary</a></h2>
<p>We covered a lot in this chapter! Now that you know about generic type
parameters, traits and trait bounds, and generic lifetime parameters, you’re
ready to write code without repetition that works in many different situations.
Generic type parameters let you apply the code to different types. Traits and
trait bounds ensure that even though the types are generic, they’ll have the
behavior the code needs. You learned how to use lifetime annotations to ensure
that this flexible code won’t have any dangling references. And all of this
analysis happens at compile time, which doesn’t affect runtime performance!</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there is much more to learn on the topics we discussed in
this chapter: Chapter 17 discusses trait objects, which are another way to use
traits. There are also more complex scenarios involving lifetime annotations
that you will only need in very advanced scenarios; for those, you should read
the <a href="../reference/index.html">Rust Reference</a>. But next, you’ll learn how to write tests in
Rust so you can make sure your code is working the way it should.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="mdbook-quiz/embed.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mdbook-quiz/embed.css"><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="writing-automated-tests"><a class="header" href="#writing-automated-tests">Writing Automated Tests</a></h1>
<p>In his 1972 essay “The Humble Programmer,” Edsger W. Dijkstra said that
“Program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but
it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.” That doesn’t mean we
shouldn’t try to test as much as we can!</p>
<p>Correctness in our programs is the extent to which our code does what we intend
it to do. Rust is designed with a high degree of concern about the correctness
of programs, but correctness is complex and not easy to prove. Rust’s type
system shoulders a huge part of this burden, but the type system cannot catch
everything. As such, Rust includes support for writing automated software tests.</p>
<p>Say we write a function <code>add_two</code> that adds 2 to whatever number is passed to
it. This function’s signature accepts an integer as a parameter and returns an
integer as a result. When we implement and compile that function, Rust does all
the type checking and borrow checking that you’ve learned so far to ensure
that, for instance, we aren’t passing a <code>String</code> value or an invalid reference
to this function. But Rust <em>can’t</em> check that this function will do precisely
what we intend, which is return the parameter plus 2 rather than, say, the
parameter plus 10 or the parameter minus 50! That’s where tests come in.</p>
<p>We can write tests that assert, for example, that when we pass <code>3</code> to the
<code>add_two</code> function, the returned value is <code>5</code>. We can run these tests whenever
we make changes to our code to make sure any existing correct behavior has not
changed.</p>
<p>Testing is a complex skill: although we can’t cover every detail about how to
write good tests in one chapter, we’ll discuss the mechanics of Rust’s testing
facilities. We’ll talk about the annotations and macros available to you when
writing your tests, the default behavior and options provided for running your
tests, and how to organize tests into unit tests and integration tests.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="how-to-write-tests"><a class="header" href="#how-to-write-tests">How to Write Tests</a></h2>
<p>Tests are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is functioning in
the expected manner. The bodies of test functions typically perform these three
actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up any needed data or state.</li>
<li>Run the code you want to test.</li>
<li>Assert the results are what you expect.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s look at the features Rust provides specifically for writing tests that
take these actions, which include the <code>test</code> attribute, a few macros, and the
<code>should_panic</code> attribute.</p>
<h3 id="the-anatomy-of-a-test-function"><a class="header" href="#the-anatomy-of-a-test-function">The Anatomy of a Test Function</a></h3>
<p>At its simplest, a test in Rust is a function that’s annotated with the <code>test</code>
attribute. Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code; one example is
the <code>derive</code> attribute we used with structs in Chapter 5. To change a function
into a test function, add <code>#[test]</code> on the line before <code>fn</code>. When you run your
tests with the <code>cargo test</code> command, Rust builds a test runner binary that runs
the annotated functions and reports on whether each
test function passes or fails.</p>
<p>Whenever we make a new library project with Cargo, a test module with a test
function in it is automatically generated for us. This module gives you a
template for writing your tests so you don’t have to look up the exact
structure and syntax every time you start a new project. You can add as many
additional test functions and as many test modules as you want!</p>
<p>We’ll explore some aspects of how tests work by experimenting with the template
test before we actually test any code. Then we’ll write some real-world tests
that call some code that we’ve written and assert that its behavior is correct.</p>
<p>Let’s create a new library project called <code>adder</code> that will add two numbers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new adder --lib
     Created library `adder` project
$ cd adder
</code></pre>
<p>The contents of the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file in your <code>adder</code> library should look like
Listing 11-1.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<!-- manual-regeneration

<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = 2 + 2;
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-1: The test module and function generated
automatically by <code>cargo new</code></span></p>
<p>For now, let’s ignore the top two lines and focus on the function. Note the
<code>#[test]</code> annotation: this attribute indicates this is a test function, so the
test runner knows to treat this function as a test. We might also have non-test
functions in the <code>tests</code> module to help set up common scenarios or perform
common operations, so we always need to indicate which functions are tests.</p>
<p>The example function body uses the <code>assert_eq!</code> macro to assert that <code>result</code>,
which contains the result of adding 2 and 2, equals 4. This assertion serves as
an example of the format for a typical test. Let’s run it to see that this test
passes.</p>
<p>The <code>cargo test</code> command runs all tests in our project, as shown in Listing
11-2.</p>

<p>Cargo compiled and ran the test. We see the line <code>running 1 test</code>. The next

the result of running that test is <code>ok</code>. The overall summary <code>test result: ok.</code>
means that all the tests passed, and the portion that reads <code>1 passed; 0 failed</code> totals the number of tests that passed or failed.</p>
<p>It’s possible to mark a test as ignored so it doesn’t run in a particular
instance; we’ll cover that in the <a href="ch11-02-running-tests.html#ignoring-some-tests-unless-specifically-requested">“Ignoring Some Tests Unless Specifically
Requested”</a><!-- ignore --> section later in this chapter. Because we
haven’t done that here, the summary shows <code>0 ignored</code>. We can also pass an
argument to the <code>cargo test</code> command to run only tests whose name matches a
string; this is called <em>filtering</em> and we’ll cover that in the <a href="ch11-02-running-tests.html#running-a-subset-of-tests-by-name">“Running a

filtered the tests being run, so the end of the summary shows <code>0 filtered out</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>0 measured</code> statistic is for benchmark tests that measure performance.
Benchmark tests are, as of this writing, only available in nightly Rust. See
<a href="../unstable-book/library-features/test.html">the documentation about benchmark tests</a> to learn more.</p>
<p>The next part of the test output starting at <code>Doc-tests adder</code> is for the
results of any documentation tests. We don’t have any documentation tests yet,
but Rust can compile any code examples that appear in our API documentation.
This feature helps keep your docs and your code in sync! We’ll discuss how to
write documentation tests in the <a href="ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html#documentation-comments-as-tests">“Documentation Comments as
Tests”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 14. For now, we’ll
ignore the <code>Doc-tests</code> output.</p>
<p>Let’s start to customize the test to our own needs. First change the name of
the <code>it_works</code> function to a different name, such as <code>exploration</code>, like so:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn exploration() {

<p>Then run <code>cargo test</code> again. The output now shows <code>exploration</code> instead of
<code>it_works</code>:</p>

<p>Now we’ll add another test, but this time we’ll make a test that fails! Tests
fail when something in the test function panics. Each test is run in a new
thread, and when the main thread sees that a test thread has died, the test is
marked as failed. In Chapter 9, we talked about how the simplest way to panic
is to call the <code>panic!</code> macro. Enter the new test as a function named
<code>another</code>, so your <em>src/lib.rs</em> file looks like Listing 11-3.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>ok</code>, the line <code>test tests::another</code> shows <code>FAILED</code>. Two new
sections appear between the individual results and the summary: the first
displays the detailed reason for each test failure. In this case, we get the
details that <code>another</code> failed because it <code>panicked at 'Make this test fail'</code> on
line 10 in the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file. The next section lists just the names of all
the failing tests, which is useful when there are lots of tests and lots of
detailed failing test output. We can use the name of a failing test to run just
that test to more easily debug it; we’ll talk more about ways to run tests in
the <a href="ch11-02-running-tests.html#controlling-how-tests-are-run">“Controlling How Tests Are Run”</a><!-- ignore
--> section.</p>
<p>The summary line displays at the end: overall, our test result is <code>FAILED</code>. We
had one test pass and one test fail.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen what the test results look like in different scenarios,
let’s look at some macros other than <code>panic!</code> that are useful in tests.</p>
<h3 id="checking-results-with-the-assert-macro"><a class="header" href="#checking-results-with-the-assert-macro">Checking Results with the <code>assert!</code> Macro</a></h3>
<p>The <code>assert!</code> macro, provided by the standard library, is useful when you want
to ensure that some condition in a test evaluates to <code>true</code>. We give the
<code>assert!</code> macro an argument that evaluates to a Boolean. If the value is
<code>true</code>, nothing happens and the test passes. If the value is <code>false</code>, the
<code>assert!</code> macro calls <code>panic!</code> to cause the test to fail. Using the <code>assert!</code>
macro helps us check that our code is functioning in the way we intend.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, Listing 5-15, we used a <code>Rectangle</code> struct and a <code>can_hold</code>
method, which are repeated here in Listing 11-5. Let’s put this code in the
<em>src/lib.rs</em> file, then write some tests for it using the <code>assert!</code> macro.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,

        self.width &gt; other.width &amp;&amp; self.height &gt; other.height
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-5: Using the <code>Rectangle</code> struct and its
<code>can_hold</code> method from Chapter 5</span></p>
<p>The <code>can_hold</code> method returns a Boolean, which means it’s a perfect use case
for the <code>assert!</code> macro. In Listing 11-6, we write a test that exercises the
<code>can_hold</code> method by creating a <code>Rectangle</code> instance that has a width of 8 and
a height of 7 and asserting that it can hold another <code>Rectangle</code> instance that
has a width of 5 and a height of 1.</p>

<p>We’ve named our test <code>larger_can_hold_smaller</code>, and we’ve created the two

<p>A common way to verify functionality is to test for equality between the result
of the code under test and the value you expect the code to return. You could
do this using the <code>assert!</code> macro and passing it an expression using the <code>==</code>
operator. However, this is such a common test that the standard library
provides a pair of macros—<code>assert_eq!</code> and <code>assert_ne!</code>—to perform this test
more conveniently. These macros compare two arguments for equality or
inequality, respectively. They’ll also print the two values if the assertion
fails, which makes it easier to see <em>why</em> the test failed; conversely, the
<code>assert!</code> macro only indicates that it got a <code>false</code> value for the <code>==</code>
expression, without printing the values that led to the <code>false</code> value.</p>
<p>In Listing 11-7, we write a function named <code>add_two</code> that adds <code>2</code> to its

</code></pre>
<p>Our test caught the bug! The <code>it_adds_two</code> test failed, and the message tells
us that the assertion that fails was <code>assertion failed: `(left == right)`</code>
and what the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> values are. This message helps us start
debugging: the <code>left</code> argument was <code>4</code> but the <code>right</code> argument, where we had
<code>add_two(2)</code>, was <code>5</code>. You can imagine that this would be especially helpful
when we have a lot of tests going on.</p>
<p>Note that in some languages and test frameworks, the parameters to equality
assertion functions are called <code>expected</code> and <code>actual</code>, and the order in which
we specify the arguments matters. However, in Rust, they’re called <code>left</code> and
<code>right</code>, and the order in which we specify the value we expect and the value
the code produces doesn’t matter. We could write the assertion in this test as
<code>assert_eq!(add_two(2), 4)</code>, which would result in the same failure message
that displays <code>assertion failed: `(left == right)`</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>assert_ne!</code> macro will pass if the two values we give it are not equal and
fail if they’re equal. This macro is most useful for cases when we’re not sure
what a value <em>will</em> be, but we know what the value definitely <em>shouldn’t</em> be.
For example, if we’re testing a function that is guaranteed to change its input
in some way, but the way in which the input is changed depends on the day of
the week that we run our tests, the best thing to assert might be that the
output of the function is not equal to the input.</p>
<p>Under the surface, the <code>assert_eq!</code> and <code>assert_ne!</code> macros use the operators
<code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>, respectively. When the assertions fail, these macros print their
arguments using debug formatting, which means the values being compared must
implement the <code>PartialEq</code> and <code>Debug</code> traits. All primitive types and most of
the standard library types implement these traits. For structs and enums that
you define yourself, you’ll need to implement <code>PartialEq</code> to assert equality of
those types. You’ll also need to implement <code>Debug</code> to print the values when the
assertion fails. Because both traits are derivable traits, as mentioned in
Listing 5-12 in Chapter 5, this is usually as straightforward as adding the
<code>#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]</code> annotation to your struct or enum definition. See
Appendix C, <a href="appendix-03-derivable-traits.html">“Derivable Traits,”</a><!-- ignore --> for more
details about these and other derivable traits.</p>
<h3 id="adding-custom-failure-messages"><a class="header" href="#adding-custom-failure-messages">Adding Custom Failure Messages</a></h3>
<p>You can also add a custom message to be printed with the failure message as
optional arguments to the <code>assert!</code>, <code>assert_eq!</code>, and <code>assert_ne!</code> macros. Any
arguments specified after the required arguments are passed along to the
<code>format!</code> macro (discussed in Chapter 8 in the <a href="ch08-02-strings.html#concatenation-with-the--operator-or-the-format-macro">“Concatenation with the <code>+</code>
Operator or the <code>format!</code>
Macro”</a><!-- ignore -->
section), so you can pass a format string that contains <code>{}</code> placeholders and
values to go in those placeholders. Custom messages are useful for documenting
what an assertion means; when a test fails, you’ll have a better idea of what
the problem is with the code.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we have a function that greets people by name and we
want to test that the name we pass into the function appears in the output:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub fn greeting(name: &amp;str) -&gt; String {
    format!(&quot;Hello {}!&quot;, name)
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn greeting_contains_name() {
        let result = greeting(&quot;Carol&quot;);
        assert!(result.contains(&quot;Carol&quot;));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The requirements for this program haven’t been agreed upon yet, and we’re
pretty sure the <code>Hello</code> text at the beginning of the greeting will change. We
decided we don’t want to have to update the test when the requirements change,
so instead of checking for exact equality to the value returned from the
<code>greeting</code> function, we’ll just assert that the output contains the text of the
input parameter.</p>
<p>Now let’s introduce a bug into this code by changing <code>greeting</code> to exclude
<code>name</code> to see what the default test failure looks like:</p>

<p>In addition to checking return values, it’s important to check that our code
handles error conditions as we expect. For example, consider the <code>Guess</code> type
that we created in Chapter 9, Listing 9-13. Other code that uses <code>Guess</code>
depends on the guarantee that <code>Guess</code> instances will contain only values
between 1 and 100. We can write a test that ensures that attempting to create a
<code>Guess</code> instance with a value outside that range panics.</p>
<p>We do this by adding the attribute <code>should_panic</code> to our test function. The
test passes if the code inside the function panics; the test fails if the code
inside the function doesn’t panic.</p>
<p>Listing 11-8 shows a test that checks that the error conditions of <code>Guess::new</code>
happen when we expect them to.</p>

<p>We don’t get a very helpful message in this case, but when we look at the test
function, we see that it’s annotated with <code>#[should_panic]</code>. The failure we got
means that the code in the test function did not cause a panic.</p>
<p>Tests that use <code>should_panic</code> can be imprecise. A <code>should_panic</code> test would
pass even if the test panics for a different reason from the one we were
expecting. To make <code>should_panic</code> tests more precise, we can add an optional
<code>expected</code> parameter to the <code>should_panic</code> attribute. The test harness will
make sure that the failure message contains the provided text. For example,
consider the modified code for <code>Guess</code> in Listing 11-9 where the <code>new</code> function
panics with different messages depending on whether the value is too small or
too large.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-9: Testing for a <code>panic!</code> with a panic message

<p>This test will pass because the value we put in the <code>should_panic</code> attribute’s
<code>expected</code> parameter is a substring of the message that the <code>Guess::new</code>
function panics with. We could have specified the entire panic message that we
expect, which in this case would be <code>Guess value must be less than or equal to 100, got 200.</code> What you choose to specify depends on how much of the panic
message is unique or dynamic and how precise you want your test to be. In this
case, a substring of the panic message is enough to ensure that the code in the
test function executes the <code>else if value &gt; 100</code> case.</p>

<p>The failure message indicates that this test did indeed panic as we expected,
but the panic message did not include the expected string <code>'Guess value must be less than or equal to 100'</code>. The panic message that we did get in this case was
<code>Guess value must be greater than or equal to 1, got 200.</code> Now we can start
figuring out where our bug is!</p>
<h3 id="using-resultt-e-in-tests"><a class="header" href="#using-resultt-e-in-tests">Using <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> in Tests</a></h3>
<p>Our tests so far all panic when they fail. We can also write tests that use
<code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>! Here’s the test from Listing 11-1, rewritten to use <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> and return an <code>Err</code> instead of panicking:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() -&gt; Result&lt;(), String&gt; {
        if 2 + 2 == 4 {
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err(String::from(&quot;two plus two does not equal four&quot;))
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>it_works</code> function now has the <code>Result&lt;(), String&gt;</code> return type. In the
body of the function, rather than calling the <code>assert_eq!</code> macro, we return
<code>Ok(())</code> when the test passes and an <code>Err</code> with a <code>String</code> inside when the test
fails.</p>
<p>Writing tests so they return a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> enables you to use the question
mark operator in the body of tests, which can be a convenient way to write
tests that should fail if any operation within them returns an <code>Err</code> variant.</p>
<p>You can’t use the <code>#[should_panic]</code> annotation on tests that use <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>. To assert that an operation returns an <code>Err</code> variant, <em>don’t</em> use the
question mark operator on the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> value. Instead, use
<code>assert!(value.is_err())</code>.</p>
<p>Now that you know several ways to write tests, let’s look at what is happening
when we run our tests and explore the different options we can use with <code>cargo test</code>.</p>

<p>Just as <code>cargo run</code> compiles your code and then runs the resulting binary,
<code>cargo test</code> compiles your code in test mode and runs the resulting test
binary. The default behavior of the binary produced by <code>cargo test</code> is to run
all the tests in parallel and capture output generated during test runs,
preventing the output from being displayed and making it easier to read the
output related to the test results. You can, however, specify command line
options to change this default behavior.</p>
<p>Some command line options go to <code>cargo test</code>, and some go to the resulting test
binary. To separate these two types of arguments, you list the arguments that
go to <code>cargo test</code> followed by the separator <code>--</code> and then the ones that go to
the test binary. Running <code>cargo test --help</code> displays the options you can use
with <code>cargo test</code>, and running <code>cargo test -- --help</code> displays the options you
can use after the separator.</p>
<h3 id="running-tests-in-parallel-or-consecutively"><a class="header" href="#running-tests-in-parallel-or-consecutively">Running Tests in Parallel or Consecutively</a></h3>
<p>When you run multiple tests, by default they run in parallel using threads,
meaning they finish running faster and you get feedback quicker. Because the
tests are running at the same time, you must make sure your tests don’t depend
on each other or on any shared state, including a shared environment, such as
the current working directory or environment variables.</p>
<p>For example, say each of your tests runs some code that creates a file on disk
named <em>test-output.txt</em> and writes some data to that file. Then each test reads
the data in that file and asserts that the file contains a particular value,
which is different in each test. Because the tests run at the same time, one
test might overwrite the file in the time between another test writing and
reading the file. The second test will then fail, not because the code is
incorrect but because the tests have interfered with each other while running
in parallel. One solution is to make sure each test writes to a different file;
another solution is to run the tests one at a time.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to run the tests in parallel or if you want more fine-grained
control over the number of threads used, you can send the <code>--test-threads</code> flag
and the number of threads you want to use to the test binary. Take a look at
the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo test -- --test-threads=1
</code></pre>
<p>We set the number of test threads to <code>1</code>, telling the program not to use any
parallelism. Running the tests using one thread will take longer than running
them in parallel, but the tests won’t interfere with each other if they share
state.</p>
<h3 id="showing-function-output"><a class="header" href="#showing-function-output">Showing Function Output</a></h3>
<p>By default, if a test passes, Rust’s test library captures anything printed to
standard output. For example, if we call <code>println!</code> in a test and the test
passes, we won’t see the <code>println!</code> output in the terminal; we’ll see only the
line that indicates the test passed. If a test fails, we’ll see whatever was
printed to standard output with the rest of the failure message.</p>

<p>Sometimes a few specific tests can be very time-consuming to execute, so you
might want to exclude them during most runs of <code>cargo test</code>. Rather than
listing as arguments all tests you do want to run, you can instead annotate the
time-consuming tests using the <code>ignore</code> attribute to exclude them, as shown
here:</p>

<p>As mentioned at the start of the chapter, testing is a complex discipline, and
different people use different terminology and organization. The Rust community
thinks about tests in terms of two main categories: unit tests and integration
tests. <em>Unit tests</em> are small and more focused, testing one module in isolation
at a time, and can test private interfaces. <em>Integration tests</em> are entirely
external to your library and use your code in the same way any other external
code would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising multiple
modules per test.</p>
<p>Writing both kinds of tests is important to ensure that the pieces of your
library are doing what you expect them to, separately and together.</p>
<h3 id="unit-tests"><a class="header" href="#unit-tests">Unit Tests</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of unit tests is to test each unit of code in isolation from the
rest of the code to quickly pinpoint where code is and isn’t working as
expected. You’ll put unit tests in the <em>src</em> directory in each file with the
code that they’re testing. The convention is to create a module named <code>tests</code>
in each file to contain the test functions and to annotate the module with
<code>cfg(test)</code>.</p>
<h4 id="the-tests-module-and-cfgtest"><a class="header" href="#the-tests-module-and-cfgtest">The Tests Module and <code>#[cfg(test)]</code></a></h4>
<p>The <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> annotation on the tests module tells Rust to compile and run
the test code only when you run <code>cargo test</code>, not when you run <code>cargo build</code>.
This saves compile time when you only want to build the library and saves space
in the resulting compiled artifact because the tests are not included. You’ll
see that because integration tests go in a different directory, they don’t need
the <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> annotation. However, because unit tests go in the same files
as the code, you’ll use <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> to specify that they shouldn’t be
included in the compiled result.</p>
<p>Recall that when we generated the new <code>adder</code> project in the first section of
this chapter, Cargo generated this code for us:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let result = 2 + 2;
        assert_eq!(result, 4);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code is the automatically generated test module. The attribute <code>cfg</code>
stands for <em>configuration</em> and tells Rust that the following item should only
be included given a certain configuration option. In this case, the
configuration option is <code>test</code>, which is provided by Rust for compiling and
running tests. By using the <code>cfg</code> attribute, Cargo compiles our test code only
if we actively run the tests with <code>cargo test</code>. This includes any helper
functions that might be within this module, in addition to the functions
annotated with <code>#[test]</code>.</p>
<h4 id="testing-private-functions"><a class="header" href="#testing-private-functions">Testing Private Functions</a></h4>
<p>There’s debate within the testing community about whether or not private
functions should be tested directly, and other languages make it difficult or
impossible to test private functions. Regardless of which testing ideology you
adhere to, Rust’s privacy rules do allow you to test private functions.
Consider the code in Listing 11-12 with the private function <code>internal_adder</code>.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub fn add_two(a: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    internal_adder(a, 2)
}

fn internal_adder(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    a + b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn internal() {
        assert_eq!(4, internal_adder(2, 2));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-12: Testing a private function</span></p>
<p>Note that the <code>internal_adder</code> function is not marked as <code>pub</code>. Tests are just
Rust code, and the <code>tests</code> module is just another module. As we discussed in
the <a href="ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html">“Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree”</a><!-- ignore -->
section, items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. In
this test, we bring all of the <code>test</code> module’s parent’s items into scope with
<code>use super::*</code>, and then the test can call <code>internal_adder</code>. If you don’t think
private functions should be tested, there’s nothing in Rust that will compel
you to do so.</p>
<h3 id="integration-tests"><a class="header" href="#integration-tests">Integration Tests</a></h3>
<p>In Rust, integration tests are entirely external to your library. They use your
library in the same way any other code would, which means they can only call
functions that are part of your library’s public API. Their purpose is to test
whether many parts of your library work together correctly. Units of code that
work correctly on their own could have problems when integrated, so test
coverage of the integrated code is important as well. To create integration
tests, you first need a <em>tests</em> directory.</p>
<h4 id="the-tests-directory"><a class="header" href="#the-tests-directory">The <em>tests</em> Directory</a></h4>
<p>We create a <em>tests</em> directory at the top level of our project directory, next
to <em>src</em>. Cargo knows to look for integration test files in this directory. We
can then make as many test files as we want, and Cargo will compile each of the
files as an individual crate.</p>
<p>Let’s create an integration test. With the code in Listing 11-12 still in the
<em>src/lib.rs</em> file, make a <em>tests</em> directory, and create a new file named
<em>tests/integration_test.rs</em>. Your directory structure should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">adder
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    └── integration_test.rs
</code></pre>
<p>Enter the code in Listing 11-13 into the <em>tests/integration_test.rs</em> file:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: tests/integration_test.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use adder;

#[test]
fn it_adds_two() {
    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 11-13: An integration test of a function in the
<code>adder</code> crate</span></p>
<p>Each file in the <code>tests</code> directory is a separate crate, so we need to bring our
library into each test crate’s scope. For that reason we add <code>use adder</code> at the
top of the code, which we didn’t need in the unit tests.</p>
<p>We don’t need to annotate any code in <em>tests/integration_test.rs</em> with
<code>#[cfg(test)]</code>. Cargo treats the <code>tests</code> directory specially and compiles files
in this directory only when we run <code>cargo test</code>. Run <code>cargo test</code> now:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The three sections of output include the unit tests, the integration test, and
the doc tests. Note that if any test in a section fails, the following sections
will not be run. For example, if a unit test fails, there won’t be any output
for integration and doc tests because those tests will only be run if all unit
tests are passing.</p>
<p>The first section for the unit tests is the same as we’ve been seeing: one line
for each unit test (one named <code>internal</code> that we added in Listing 11-12) and
then a summary line for the unit tests.</p>
<p>The integration tests section starts with the line <code>Running tests/integration_test.rs</code>. Next, there is a line for each test function in
that integration test and a summary line for the results of the integration
test just before the <code>Doc-tests adder</code> section starts.</p>
<p>Each integration test file has its own section, so if we add more files in the
<em>tests</em> directory, there will be more integration test sections.</p>
<p>We can still run a particular integration test function by specifying the test
function’s name as an argument to <code>cargo test</code>. To run all the tests in a
particular integration test file, use the <code>--test</code> argument of <code>cargo test</code>
followed by the name of the file:</p>

<h4 id="submodules-in-integration-tests"><a class="header" href="#submodules-in-integration-tests">Submodules in Integration Tests</a></h4>
<p>As you add more integration tests, you might want to make more files in the
<em>tests</em> directory to help organize them; for example, you can group the test
functions by the functionality they’re testing. As mentioned earlier, each file
in the <em>tests</em> directory is compiled as its own separate crate, which is useful
for creating separate scopes to more closely imitate the way end users will be
using your crate. However, this means files in the <em>tests</em> directory don’t
share the same behavior as files in <em>src</em> do, as you learned in Chapter 7
regarding how to separate code into modules and files.</p>
<p>The different behavior of <em>tests</em> directory files is most noticeable when you
have a set of helper functions to use in multiple integration test files and
you try to follow the steps in the <a href="ch07-05-separating-modules-into-different-files.html">“Separating Modules into Different
Files”</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 7 to
extract them into a common module. For example, if we create <em>tests/common.rs</em>
and place a function named <code>setup</code> in it, we can add some code to <code>setup</code> that
we want to call from multiple test functions in multiple test files:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: tests/common.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust noplayground">pub fn setup() {
    // setup code specific to your library's tests would go here
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we run the tests again, we’ll see a new section in the test output for the
<em>common.rs</em> file, even though this file doesn’t contain any test functions nor
did we call the <code>setup</code> function from anywhere:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Having <code>common</code> appear in the test results with <code>running 0 tests</code> displayed for
it is not what we wanted. We just wanted to share some code with the other
integration test files.</p>
<p>To avoid having <code>common</code> appear in the test output, instead of creating
<em>tests/common.rs</em>, we’ll create <em>tests/common/mod.rs</em>. The project directory
now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    ├── common
    │   └── mod.rs
    └── integration_test.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This is the older naming convention that Rust also understands that we
mentioned in the <a href="ch07-05-separating-modules-into-different-files.html#alternate-file-paths">“Alternate File Paths”</a><!-- ignore --> section of
Chapter 7. Naming the file this way tells Rust not to treat the <code>common</code> module
as an integration test file. When we move the <code>setup</code> function code into
<em>tests/common/mod.rs</em> and delete the <em>tests/common.rs</em> file, the section in the
test output will no longer appear. Files in subdirectories of the <em>tests</em>
directory don’t get compiled as separate crates or have sections in the test
output.</p>
<p>After we’ve created <em>tests/common/mod.rs</em>, we can use it from any of the
integration test files as a module. Here’s an example of calling the <code>setup</code>
function from the <code>it_adds_two</code> test in <em>tests/integration_test.rs</em>:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: tests/integration_test.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use adder;

mod common;

#[test]
fn it_adds_two() {
    common::setup();
    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>mod common;</code> declaration is the same as the module declaration
we demonstrated in Listing 7-21. Then in the test function, we can call the
<code>common::setup()</code> function.</p>
<h4 id="integration-tests-for-binary-crates"><a class="header" href="#integration-tests-for-binary-crates">Integration Tests for Binary Crates</a></h4>
<p>If our project is a binary crate that only contains a <em>src/main.rs</em> file and
doesn’t have a <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, we can’t create integration tests in the
<em>tests</em> directory and bring functions defined in the <em>src/main.rs</em> file into
scope with a <code>use</code> statement. Only library crates expose functions that other
crates can use; binary crates are meant to be run on their own.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons Rust projects that provide a binary have a
straightforward <em>src/main.rs</em> file that calls logic that lives in the
<em>src/lib.rs</em> file. Using that structure, integration tests <em>can</em> test the
library crate with <code>use</code> to make the important functionality available.
If the important functionality works, the small amount of code in the
<em>src/main.rs</em> file will work as well, and that small amount of code doesn’t
need to be tested.</p>
<h2 id="summary-10"><a class="header" href="#summary-10">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Rust’s testing features provide a way to specify how code should function to
ensure it continues to work as you expect, even as you make changes. Unit tests
exercise different parts of a library separately and can test private
implementation details. Integration tests check that many parts of the library
work together correctly, and they use the library’s public API to test the code
in the same way external code will use it. Even though Rust’s type system and
ownership rules help prevent some kinds of bugs, tests are still important to
reduce logic bugs having to do with how your code is expected to behave.</p>

<p>This chapter is a recap of the many skills you’ve learned so far and an
exploration of a few more standard library features. We’ll build a command line
tool that interacts with file and command line input/output to practice some of
the Rust concepts you now have under your belt.</p>
<p>Rust’s speed, safety, single binary output, and cross-platform support make it
an ideal language for creating command line tools, so for our project, we’ll
make our own version of the classic command line search tool <code>grep</code>
(<strong>g</strong>lobally search a <strong>r</strong>egular <strong>e</strong>xpression and <strong>p</strong>rint). In the
simplest use case, <code>grep</code> searches a specified file for a specified string. To
do so, <code>grep</code> takes as its arguments a file path and a string. Then it reads
the file, finds lines in that file that contain the string argument, and prints
those lines.</p>
<p>Along the way, we’ll show how to make our command line tool use the terminal
features that many other command line tools use. We’ll read the value of an
environment variable to allow the user to configure the behavior of our tool.
We’ll also print error messages to the standard error console stream (<code>stderr</code>)
instead of standard output (<code>stdout</code>), so, for example, the user can redirect
successful output to a file while still seeing error messages onscreen.</p>
<p>One Rust community member, Andrew Gallant, has already created a fully
featured, very fast version of <code>grep</code>, called <code>ripgrep</code>. By comparison, our
version will be fairly simple, but this chapter will give you some of the
background knowledge you need to understand a real-world project such as
<code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p>Our <code>grep</code> project will combine a number of concepts you’ve learned so far:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="accepting-command-line-arguments"><a class="header" href="#accepting-command-line-arguments">Accepting Command Line Arguments</a></h2>
<p>Let’s create a new project with, as always, <code>cargo new</code>. We’ll call our project
<code>minigrep</code> to distinguish it from the <code>grep</code> tool that you might already have
on your system.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo new minigrep
     Created binary (application) `minigrep` project
$ cd minigrep
</code></pre>
<p>The first task is to make <code>minigrep</code> accept its two command line arguments: the
file path and a string to search for. That is, we want to be able to run our
program with <code>cargo run</code>, two hyphens to indicate the following arguments are
for our program rather than for <code>cargo</code>, a string to search for, and a path to
a file to search in, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- searchstring example-filename.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Right now, the program generated by <code>cargo new</code> cannot process arguments we
give it. Some existing libraries on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> can help
with writing a program that accepts command line arguments, but because you’re
just learning this concept, let’s implement this capability ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="reading-the-argument-values"><a class="header" href="#reading-the-argument-values">Reading the Argument Values</a></h3>
<p>To enable <code>minigrep</code> to read the values of command line arguments we pass to
it, we’ll need the <code>std::env::args</code> function provided in Rust’s standard
library. This function returns an iterator of the command line arguments passed
to <code>minigrep</code>. We’ll cover iterators fully in <a href="ch13-00-functional-features.html">Chapter 13</a><!-- ignore
-->. For now, you only need to know two details about iterators: iterators
produce a series of values, and we can call the <code>collect</code> method on an iterator
to turn it into a collection, such as a vector, that contains all the elements
the iterator produces.</p>
<p>The code in Listing 12-1 allows your <code>minigrep</code> program to read any command
line arguments passed to it and then collect the values into a vector.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();
    dbg!(args);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-1: Collecting the command line arguments into
a vector and printing them</span></p>
<p>First, we bring the <code>std::env</code> module into scope with a <code>use</code> statement so we
can use its <code>args</code> function. Notice that the <code>std::env::args</code> function is
nested in two levels of modules. As we discussed in <a href="ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html#creating-idiomatic-use-paths">Chapter
7</a><!-- ignore -->, in cases where the desired function is
nested in more than one module, we’ve chosen to bring the parent module into
scope rather than the function. By doing so, we can easily use other functions
from <code>std::env</code>. It’s also less ambiguous than adding <code>use std::env::args</code> and
then calling the function with just <code>args</code>, because <code>args</code> might easily be
mistaken for a function that’s defined in the current module.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="the-args-function-and-invalid-unicode"><a class="header" href="#the-args-function-and-invalid-unicode">The <code>args</code> Function and Invalid Unicode</a></h3>
<p>Note that <code>std::env::args</code> will panic if any argument contains invalid
Unicode. If your program needs to accept arguments containing invalid
Unicode, use <code>std::env::args_os</code> instead. That function returns an iterator
that produces <code>OsString</code> values instead of <code>String</code> values. We’ve chosen to
use <code>std::env::args</code> here for simplicity, because <code>OsString</code> values differ
per platform and are more complex to work with than <code>String</code> values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the first line of <code>main</code>, we call <code>env::args</code>, and we immediately use
<code>collect</code> to turn the iterator into a vector containing all the values produced
by the iterator. We can use the <code>collect</code> function to create many kinds of
collections, so we explicitly annotate the type of <code>args</code> to specify that we
want a vector of strings. Although we very rarely need to annotate types in
Rust, <code>collect</code> is one function you do often need to annotate because Rust
isn’t able to infer the kind of collection you want.</p>
<p>Finally, we print the vector using the debug macro. Let’s try running the code
first with no arguments and then with two arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.61s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep`
[src/main.rs:5] args = [
    &quot;target/debug/minigrep&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- needle haystack
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.57s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep needle haystack`
[src/main.rs:5] args = [
    &quot;target/debug/minigrep&quot;,
    &quot;needle&quot;,
    &quot;haystack&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the first value in the vector is <code>&quot;target/debug/minigrep&quot;</code>, which
is the name of our binary. This matches the behavior of the arguments list in
C, letting programs use the name by which they were invoked in their execution.
It’s often convenient to have access to the program name in case you want to
print it in messages or change behavior of the program based on what command
line alias was used to invoke the program. But for the purposes of this
chapter, we’ll ignore it and save only the two arguments we need.</p>
<h3 id="saving-the-argument-values-in-variables"><a class="header" href="#saving-the-argument-values-in-variables">Saving the Argument Values in Variables</a></h3>
<p>The program is currently able to access the values specified as command line
arguments. Now we need to save the values of the two arguments in variables so
we can use the values throughout the rest of the program. We do that in Listing
12-2.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-rust should_panic noplayground">use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();

    let query = &amp;args[1];
    let file_path = &amp;args[2];

    println!(&quot;Searching for {}&quot;, query);
    println!(&quot;In file {}&quot;, file_path);
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-2: Creating variables to hold the query
argument and file path argument</span></p>
<p>As we saw when we printed the vector, the program’s name takes up the first
value in the vector at <code>args[0]</code>, so we’re starting arguments at index <code>1</code>. The
first argument <code>minigrep</code> takes is the string we’re searching for, so we put a
reference to the first argument in the variable <code>query</code>. The second argument
will be the file path, so we put a reference to the second argument in the
variable <code>file_path</code>.</p>
<p>We temporarily print the values of these variables to prove that the code is
working as we intend. Let’s run this program again with the arguments <code>test</code>
and <code>sample.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- test sample.txt

</code></pre>
<p>Great, the program is working! The values of the arguments we need are being
saved into the right variables. Later we’ll add some error handling to deal
with certain potential erroneous situations, such as when the user provides no
arguments; for now, we’ll ignore that situation and work on adding file-reading
capabilities instead.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="reading-a-file"><a class="header" href="#reading-a-file">Reading a File</a></h2>
<p>Now we’ll add functionality to read the file specified in the <code>file_path</code>
argument. First, we need a sample file to test it with: we’ll use a file with a
small amount of text over multiple lines with some repeated words. Listing 12-3
has an Emily Dickinson poem that will work well! Create a file called
<em>poem.txt</em> at the root level of your project, and enter the poem “I’m Nobody!

<p>First, we bring in a relevant part of the standard library with a <code>use</code>

</code></pre>
<p>Great! The code read and then printed the contents of the file. But the code
has a few flaws. At the moment, the <code>main</code> function has multiple
responsibilities: generally, functions are clearer and easier to maintain if
each function is responsible for only one idea. The other problem is that we’re
not handling errors as well as we could. The program is still small, so these
flaws aren’t a big problem, but as the program grows, it will be harder to fix
them cleanly. It’s good practice to begin refactoring early on when developing
a program, because it’s much easier to refactor smaller amounts of code. We’ll
do that next.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="refactoring-to-improve-modularity-and-error-handling"><a class="header" href="#refactoring-to-improve-modularity-and-error-handling">Refactoring to Improve Modularity and Error Handling</a></h2>
<p>To improve our program, we’ll fix four problems that have to do with the
program’s structure and how it’s handling potential errors. First, our <code>main</code>
function now performs two tasks: it parses arguments and reads files. As our
program grows, the number of separate tasks the <code>main</code> function handles will
increase. As a function gains responsibilities, it becomes more difficult to
reason about, harder to test, and harder to change without breaking one of its
parts. It’s best to separate functionality so each function is responsible for
one task.</p>
<p>This issue also ties into the second problem: although <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code>
are configuration variables to our program, variables like <code>contents</code> are used
to perform the program’s logic. The longer <code>main</code> becomes, the more variables
we’ll need to bring into scope; the more variables we have in scope, the harder
it will be to keep track of the purpose of each. It’s best to group the
configuration variables into one structure to make their purpose clear.</p>
<p>The third problem is that we’ve used <code>expect</code> to print an error message when
reading the file fails, but the error message just prints <code>Should have been able to read the file</code>. Reading a file can fail in a number of ways: for
example, the file could be missing, or we might not have permission to open it.
Right now, regardless of the situation, we’d print the same error message for
everything, which wouldn’t give the user any information!</p>
<p>Fourth, we use <code>expect</code> repeatedly to handle different errors, and if the user
runs our program without specifying enough arguments, they’ll get an <code>index out of bounds</code> error from Rust that doesn’t clearly explain the problem. It would
be best if all the error-handling code were in one place so future maintainers
had only one place to consult the code if the error-handling logic needed to
change. Having all the error-handling code in one place will also ensure that
we’re printing messages that will be meaningful to our end users.</p>
<p>Let’s address these four problems by refactoring our project.</p>
<h3 id="separation-of-concerns-for-binary-projects"><a class="header" href="#separation-of-concerns-for-binary-projects">Separation of Concerns for Binary Projects</a></h3>
<p>The organizational problem of allocating responsibility for multiple tasks to
the <code>main</code> function is common to many binary projects. As a result, the Rust
community has developed guidelines for splitting the separate concerns of a
binary program when <code>main</code> starts getting large. This process has the following
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split your program into a <em>main.rs</em> and a <em>lib.rs</em> and move your program’s
logic to <em>lib.rs</em>.</li>
<li>As long as your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in
<em>main.rs</em>.</li>
<li>When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it
from <em>main.rs</em> and move it to <em>lib.rs</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The responsibilities that remain in the <code>main</code> function after this process
should be limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values</li>
<li>Setting up any other configuration</li>
<li>Calling a <code>run</code> function in <em>lib.rs</em></li>
<li>Handling the error if <code>run</code> returns an error</li>
</ul>
<p>This pattern is about separating concerns: <em>main.rs</em> handles running the
program, and <em>lib.rs</em> handles all the logic of the task at hand. Because you
can’t test the <code>main</code> function directly, this structure lets you test all of
your program’s logic by moving it into functions in <em>lib.rs</em>. The code that
remains in <em>main.rs</em> will be small enough to verify its correctness by reading
it. Let’s rework our program by following this process.</p>
<h4 id="extracting-the-argument-parser"><a class="header" href="#extracting-the-argument-parser">Extracting the Argument Parser</a></h4>
<p>We’ll extract the functionality for parsing arguments into a function that
<code>main</code> will call to prepare for moving the command line parsing logic to
<em>src/lib.rs</em>. Listing 12-5 shows the new start of <code>main</code> that calls a new
function <code>parse_config</code>, which we’ll define in <em>src/main.rs</em> for the moment.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

    let (query, file_path) = parse_config(&amp;args);

    // --snip--

fn parse_config(args: &amp;[String]) -&gt; (&amp;str, &amp;str) {
    let query = &amp;args[1];
    let file_path = &amp;args[2];

    (query, file_path)
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-5: Extracting a <code>parse_config</code> function from
<code>main</code></span></p>
<p>We’re still collecting the command line arguments into a vector, but instead of
assigning the argument value at index 1 to the variable <code>query</code> and the
argument value at index 2 to the variable <code>file_path</code> within the <code>main</code>
function, we pass the whole vector to the <code>parse_config</code> function. The
<code>parse_config</code> function then holds the logic that determines which argument
goes in which variable and passes the values back to <code>main</code>. We still create
the <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> variables in <code>main</code>, but <code>main</code> no longer has the
responsibility of determining how the command line arguments and variables
correspond.</p>
<p>This rework may seem like overkill for our small program, but we’re refactoring
in small, incremental steps. After making this change, run the program again to
verify that the argument parsing still works. It’s good to check your progress
often, to help identify the cause of problems when they occur.</p>
<h4 id="grouping-configuration-values"><a class="header" href="#grouping-configuration-values">Grouping Configuration Values</a></h4>
<p>We can take another small step to improve the <code>parse_config</code> function further.
At the moment, we’re returning a tuple, but then we immediately break that
tuple into individual parts again. This is a sign that perhaps we don’t have
the right abstraction yet.</p>
<p>Another indicator that shows there’s room for improvement is the <code>config</code> part
of <code>parse_config</code>, which implies that the two values we return are related and
are both part of one configuration value. We’re not currently conveying this
meaning in the structure of the data other than by grouping the two values into
a tuple; we’ll instead put the two values into one struct and give each of the
struct fields a meaningful name. Doing so will make it easier for future
maintainers of this code to understand how the different values relate to each
other and what their purpose is.</p>
<p>Listing 12-6 shows the improvements to the <code>parse_config</code> function.</p>

    Config { query, file_path }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-6: Refactoring <code>parse_config</code> to return an
instance of a <code>Config</code> struct</span></p>
<p>We’ve added a struct named <code>Config</code> defined to have fields named <code>query</code> and
<code>file_path</code>. The signature of <code>parse_config</code> now indicates that it returns a
<code>Config</code> value. In the body of <code>parse_config</code>, where we used to return
string slices that reference <code>String</code> values in <code>args</code>, we now define <code>Config</code>
to contain owned <code>String</code> values. The <code>args</code> variable in <code>main</code> is the owner of
the argument values and is only letting the <code>parse_config</code> function borrow
them, which means we’d violate Rust’s borrowing rules if <code>Config</code> tried to take
ownership of the values in <code>args</code>.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways we could manage the <code>String</code> data; the easiest,
though somewhat inefficient, route is to call the <code>clone</code> method on the values.
This will make a full copy of the data for the <code>Config</code> instance to own, which
takes more time and memory than storing a reference to the string data.
However, cloning the data also makes our code very straightforward because we
don’t have to manage the lifetimes of the references; in this circumstance,
giving up a little performance to gain simplicity is a worthwhile trade-off.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="the-trade-offs-of-using-clone"><a class="header" href="#the-trade-offs-of-using-clone">The Trade-Offs of Using <code>clone</code></a></h3>
<p>There’s a tendency among many Rustaceans to avoid using <code>clone</code> to fix
ownership problems because of its runtime cost. In
<a href="ch13-00-functional-features.html">Chapter 13</a><!-- ignore -->, you’ll learn how to use more efficient
methods in this type of situation. But for now, it’s okay to copy a few
strings to continue making progress because you’ll make these copies only
once and your file path and query string are very small. It’s better to have
a working program that’s a bit inefficient than to try to hyperoptimize code
on your first pass. As you become more experienced with Rust, it’ll be
easier to start with the most efficient solution, but for now, it’s
perfectly acceptable to call <code>clone</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve updated <code>main</code> so it places the instance of <code>Config</code> returned by
<code>parse_config</code> into a variable named <code>config</code>, and we updated the code that
previously used the separate <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> variables so it now uses
the fields on the <code>Config</code> struct instead.</p>
<p>Now our code more clearly conveys that <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> are related and
that their purpose is to configure how the program will work. Any code that
uses these values knows to find them in the <code>config</code> instance in the fields
named for their purpose.</p>
<h4 id="creating-a-constructor-for-config"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-constructor-for-config">Creating a Constructor for <code>Config</code></a></h4>
<p>So far, we’ve extracted the logic responsible for parsing the command line
arguments from <code>main</code> and placed it in the <code>parse_config</code> function. Doing so
helped us to see that the <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> values were related and that
relationship should be conveyed in our code. We then added a <code>Config</code> struct to
name the related purpose of <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> and to be able to return the
values’ names as struct field names from the <code>parse_config</code> function.</p>
<p>So now that the purpose of the <code>parse_config</code> function is to create a <code>Config</code>
instance, we can change <code>parse_config</code> from a plain function to a function
named <code>new</code> that is associated with the <code>Config</code> struct. Making this change
will make the code more idiomatic. We can create instances of types in the
standard library, such as <code>String</code>, by calling <code>String::new</code>. Similarly, by
changing <code>parse_config</code> into a <code>new</code> function associated with <code>Config</code>, we’ll
be able to create instances of <code>Config</code> by calling <code>Config::new</code>. Listing 12-7
shows the changes we need to make.</p>

<p>This code is similar to <a href="ch09-03-to-panic-or-not-to-panic.html#creating-custom-types-for-validation">the <code>Guess::new</code> function we wrote in Listing
9-13</a><!-- ignore -->, where we called <code>panic!</code> when the
<code>value</code> argument was out of the range of valid values. Instead of checking for
a range of values here, we’re checking that the length of <code>args</code> is at least 3
and the rest of the function can operate under the assumption that this
condition has been met. If <code>args</code> has fewer than three items, this condition
will be true, and we call the <code>panic!</code> macro to end the program immediately.</p>
<p>With these extra few lines of code in <code>new</code>, let’s run the program without any
arguments again to see what the error looks like now:</p>

<p>This output is better: we now have a reasonable error message. However, we also
have extraneous information we don’t want to give to our users. Perhaps using
the technique we used in Listing 9-13 isn’t the best to use here: a call to
<code>panic!</code> is more appropriate for a programming problem than a usage problem,
<a href="ch09-03-to-panic-or-not-to-panic.html#guidelines-for-error-handling">as discussed in Chapter 9</a><!-- ignore -->. Instead,
we’ll use the other technique you learned about in Chapter 9—<a href="ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">returning a

<p>We can instead return a <code>Result</code> value that will contain a <code>Config</code> instance in
the successful case and will describe the problem in the error case. We’re also
going to change the function name from <code>new</code> to <code>build</code> because many
programmers expect <code>new</code> functions to never fail. When <code>Config::build</code> is
communicating to <code>main</code>, we can use the <code>Result</code> type to signal there was a
problem. Then we can change <code>main</code> to convert an <code>Err</code> variant into a more
practical error for our users without the surrounding text about <code>thread 'main'</code> and <code>RUST_BACKTRACE</code> that a call to <code>panic!</code> causes.</p>
<p>Listing 12-9 shows the changes we need to make to the return value of the
function we’re now calling <code>Config::build</code> and the body of the function needed
to return a <code>Result</code>. Note that this won’t compile until we update <code>main</code> as
well, which we’ll do in the next listing.</p>

<p>Our <code>build</code> function returns a <code>Result</code> with a <code>Config</code> instance in the success
case and a <code>&amp;'static str</code> in the error case. Our error values will always be
string literals that have the <code>'static</code> lifetime.</p>
<p>We’ve made two changes in the body of the function: instead of calling <code>panic!</code>
when the user doesn’t pass enough arguments, we now return an <code>Err</code> value, and
we’ve wrapped the <code>Config</code> return value in an <code>Ok</code>. These changes make the
function conform to its new type signature.</p>
<p>Returning an <code>Err</code> value from <code>Config::build</code> allows the <code>main</code> function to
handle the <code>Result</code> value returned from the <code>build</code> function and exit the
process more cleanly in the error case.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-10: Exiting with an error code if building a
<code>Config</code> fails</span></p>
<p>In this listing, we’ve used a method we haven’t covered in detail yet:
<code>unwrap_or_else</code>, which is defined on <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> by the standard library.
Using <code>unwrap_or_else</code> allows us to define some custom, non-<code>panic!</code> error
handling. If the <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code> value, this method’s behavior is similar
to <code>unwrap</code>: it returns the inner value <code>Ok</code> is wrapping. However, if the value
is an <code>Err</code> value, this method calls the code in the <em>closure</em>, which is an
anonymous function we define and pass as an argument to <code>unwrap_or_else</code>. We’ll
cover closures in more detail in <a href="ch13-00-functional-features.html">Chapter 13</a><!-- ignore -->. For now,
you just need to know that <code>unwrap_or_else</code> will pass the inner value of the
<code>Err</code>, which in this case is the static string <code>&quot;not enough arguments&quot;</code> that we
added in Listing 12-9, to our closure in the argument <code>err</code> that appears
between the vertical pipes. The code in the closure can then use the <code>err</code>
value when it runs.</p>
<p>We’ve added a new <code>use</code> line to bring <code>process</code> from the standard library into
scope. The code in the closure that will be run in the error case is only two
lines: we print the <code>err</code> value and then call <code>process::exit</code>. The
<code>process::exit</code> function will stop the program immediately and return the
number that was passed as the exit status code. This is similar to the
<code>panic!</code>-based handling we used in Listing 12-8, but we no longer get all the
extra output. Let’s try it:</p>

<p>Now that we’ve finished refactoring the configuration parsing, let’s turn to
the program’s logic. As we stated in <a href="ch12-03-improving-error-handling-and-modularity.html#separation-of-concerns-for-binary-projects">“Separation of Concerns for Binary

extract a function named <code>run</code> that will hold all the logic currently in the

<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-12: Changing the <code>run</code> function to return
<code>Result</code></span></p>
<p>We’ve made three significant changes here. First, we changed the return type of
the <code>run</code> function to <code>Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt;</code>. This function previously
returned the unit type, <code>()</code>, and we keep that as the value returned in the
<code>Ok</code> case.</p>
<p>For the error type, we used the <em>trait object</em> <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> (and we’ve
brought <code>std::error::Error</code> into scope with a <code>use</code> statement at the top).
We’ll cover trait objects in <a href="ch17-00-oop.html">Chapter 17</a><!-- ignore -->. For now, just
know that <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> means the function will return a type that
implements the <code>Error</code> trait, but we don’t have to specify what particular type
the return value will be. This gives us flexibility to return error values that
may be of different types in different error cases. The <code>dyn</code> keyword is short
for “dynamic.”</p>
<p>Second, we’ve removed the call to <code>expect</code> in favor of the <code>?</code> operator, as we
talked about in <a href="ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator">Chapter 9</a><!-- ignore -->. Rather than
<code>panic!</code> on an error, <code>?</code> will return the error value from the current function
for the caller to handle.</p>
<p>Third, the <code>run</code> function now returns an <code>Ok</code> value in the success case.
We’ve declared the <code>run</code> function’s success type as <code>()</code> in the signature,
which means we need to wrap the unit type value in the <code>Ok</code> value. This
<code>Ok(())</code> syntax might look a bit strange at first, but using <code>()</code> like this is
the idiomatic way to indicate that we’re calling <code>run</code> for its side effects
only; it doesn’t return a value we need.</p>

<p>We use <code>if let</code> rather than <code>unwrap_or_else</code> to check whether <code>run</code> returns an
<code>Err</code> value and call <code>process::exit(1)</code> if it does. The <code>run</code> function doesn’t
return a value that we want to <code>unwrap</code> in the same way that <code>Config::build</code>
returns the <code>Config</code> instance. Because <code>run</code> returns <code>()</code> in the success case,
we only care about detecting an error, so we don’t need <code>unwrap_or_else</code> to
return the unwrapped value, which would only be <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>The bodies of the <code>if let</code> and the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> functions are the same in
both cases: we print the error and exit.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-14: Using the <code>minigrep</code> library crate in
<em>src/main.rs</em></span></p>
<p>We add a <code>use minigrep::Config</code> line to bring the <code>Config</code> type from the
library crate into the binary crate’s scope, and we prefix the <code>run</code> function
with our crate name. Now all the functionality should be connected and should
work. Run the program with <code>cargo run</code> and make sure everything works
correctly.</p>
<p>Whew! That was a lot of work, but we’ve set ourselves up for success in the
future. Now it’s much easier to handle errors, and we’ve made the code more
modular. Almost all of our work will be done in <em>src/lib.rs</em> from here on out.</p>
<p>Let’s take advantage of this newfound modularity by doing something that would
have been difficult with the old code but is easy with the new code: we’ll
write some tests!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="developing-the-librarys-functionality-with-test-driven-development"><a class="header" href="#developing-the-librarys-functionality-with-test-driven-development">Developing the Library’s Functionality with Test-Driven Development</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve extracted the logic into <em>src/lib.rs</em> and left the argument
collecting and error handling in <em>src/main.rs</em>, it’s much easier to write tests
for the core functionality of our code. We can call functions directly with
various arguments and check return values without having to call our binary
from the command line.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll add the searching logic to the <code>minigrep</code> program
using the test-driven development (TDD) process with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you
expect.</li>
<li>Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.</li>
<li>Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests
continue to pass.</li>
<li>Repeat from step 1!</li>
</ol>
<p>Though it’s just one of many ways to write software, TDD can help drive code
design. Writing the test before you write the code that makes the test pass
helps to maintain high test coverage throughout the process.</p>
<p>We’ll test drive the implementation of the functionality that will actually do
the searching for the query string in the file contents and produce a list of
lines that match the query. We’ll add this functionality in a function called
<code>search</code>.</p>
<h3 id="writing-a-failing-test"><a class="header" href="#writing-a-failing-test">Writing a Failing Test</a></h3>
<p>Because we don’t need them anymore, let’s remove the <code>println!</code> statements from
<em>src/lib.rs</em> and <em>src/main.rs</em> that we used to check the program’s behavior.
Then, in <em>src/lib.rs</em>, add a <code>tests</code> module with a test function, as we did in
<a href="ch11-01-writing-tests.html#the-anatomy-of-a-test-function">Chapter 11</a><!-- ignore -->. The test function specifies the
behavior we want the <code>search</code> function to have: it will take a query and the
text to search, and it will return only the lines from the text that contain
the query. Listing 12-15 shows this test, which won’t compile yet.</p>

function so our test will compile</span></p>
<p>Notice that we need to define an explicit lifetime <code>'a</code> in the signature of
<code>search</code> and use that lifetime with the <code>contents</code> argument and the return
value. Recall in <a href="ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html">Chapter 10</a><!-- ignore --> that the lifetime
parameters specify which argument lifetime is connected to the lifetime of the
return value. In this case, we indicate that the returned vector should contain
string slices that reference slices of the argument <code>contents</code> (rather than the
argument <code>query</code>).</p>
<p>In other words, we tell Rust that the data returned by the <code>search</code> function
will live as long as the data passed into the <code>search</code> function in the
<code>contents</code> argument. This is important! The data referenced <em>by</em> a slice needs
to be valid for the reference to be valid; if the compiler assumes we’re making
string slices of <code>query</code> rather than <code>contents</code>, it will do its safety checking
incorrectly.</p>
<p>If we forget the lifetime annotations and try to compile this function, we’ll
get this error:</p>

<p>Rust can’t possibly know which of the two arguments we need, so we need to tell
it explicitly. Because <code>contents</code> is the argument that contains all of our text
and we want to return the parts of that text that match, we know <code>contents</code> is
the argument that should be connected to the return value using the lifetime
syntax.</p>
<p>Other programming languages don’t require you to connect arguments to return
values in the signature, but this practice will get easier over time. You might
want to compare this example with the <a href="ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html#validating-references-with-lifetimes">“Validating References with
Lifetimes”</a><!-- ignore --> section in

we return the vector, as shown in Listing 12-19.</p>

<p>Our test passed, so we know it works!</p>
<p>At this point, we could consider opportunities for refactoring the
implementation of the search function while keeping the tests passing to
maintain the same functionality. The code in the search function isn’t too bad,
but it doesn’t take advantage of some useful features of iterators. We’ll
return to this example in <a href="ch13-02-iterators.html">Chapter 13</a><!-- ignore -->, where
we’ll explore iterators in detail, and look at how to improve it.</p>

<p>Now that the <code>search</code> function is working and tested, we need to call <code>search</code>
from our <code>run</code> function. We need to pass the <code>config.query</code> value and the

<p>We’re still using a <code>for</code> loop to return each line from <code>search</code> and print it.</p>
<p>Now the entire program should work! Let’s try it out, first with a word that
should return exactly one line from the Emily Dickinson poem, “frog”:</p>

<p>Cool! Now let’s try a word that will match multiple lines, like “body”:</p>

I'm nobody! Who are you?

<p>And finally, let’s make sure that we don’t get any lines when we search for a
word that isn’t anywhere in the poem, such as “monomorphization”:</p>

<p>Excellent! We’ve built our own mini version of a classic tool and learned a lot
about how to structure applications. We’ve also learned a bit about file input
and output, lifetimes, testing, and command line parsing.</p>
<p>To round out this project, we’ll briefly demonstrate how to work with
environment variables and how to print to standard error, both of which are
useful when you’re writing command line programs.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="working-with-environment-variables"><a class="header" href="#working-with-environment-variables">Working with Environment Variables</a></h2>
<p>We’ll improve <code>minigrep</code> by adding an extra feature: an option for
case-insensitive searching that the user can turn on via an environment
variable. We could make this feature a command line option and require that
users enter it each time they want it to apply, but by instead making it an
environment variable, we allow our users to set the environment variable once
and have all their searches be case insensitive in that terminal session.</p>

<p>We first add a new <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function that will be called when
the environment variable has a value. We’ll continue to follow the TDD process,
so the first step is again to write a failing test. We’ll add a new test for
the new <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function and rename our old test from
<code>one_result</code> to <code>case_sensitive</code> to clarify the differences between the two
tests, as shown in Listing 12-20.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-20: Adding a new failing test for the
case-insensitive function we’re about to add</span></p>
<p>Note that we’ve edited the old test’s <code>contents</code> too. We’ve added a new line
with the text <code>&quot;Duct tape.&quot;</code> using a capital D that shouldn’t match the query
<code>&quot;duct&quot;</code> when we’re searching in a case-sensitive manner. Changing the old test
in this way helps ensure that we don’t accidentally break the case-sensitive
search functionality that we’ve already implemented. This test should pass now
and should continue to pass as we work on the case-insensitive search.</p>
<p>The new test for the case-<em>insensitive</em> search uses <code>&quot;rUsT&quot;</code> as its query. In
the <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function we’re about to add, the query <code>&quot;rUsT&quot;</code>
should match the line containing <code>&quot;Rust:&quot;</code> with a capital R and match the line
<code>&quot;Trust me.&quot;</code> even though both have different casing from the query. This is
our failing test, and it will fail to compile because we haven’t yet defined
the <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function. Feel free to add a skeleton
implementation that always returns an empty vector, similar to the way we did
for the <code>search</code> function in Listing 12-16 to see the test compile and fail.</p>

<p>The <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function, shown in Listing 12-21, will be almost
the same as the <code>search</code> function. The only difference is that we’ll lowercase
the <code>query</code> and each <code>line</code> so whatever the case of the input arguments,
they’ll be the same case when we check whether the line contains the query.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-21: Defining the <code>search_case_insensitive</code>
function to lowercase the query and the line before comparing them</span></p>
<p>First, we lowercase the <code>query</code> string and store it in a shadowed variable with
the same name. Calling <code>to_lowercase</code> on the query is necessary so no
matter whether the user’s query is <code>&quot;rust&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;RUST&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Rust&quot;</code>, or <code>&quot;rUsT&quot;</code>,
we’ll treat the query as if it were <code>&quot;rust&quot;</code> and be insensitive to the case.
While <code>to_lowercase</code> will handle basic Unicode, it won’t be 100% accurate. If
we were writing a real application, we’d want to do a bit more work here, but
this section is about environment variables, not Unicode, so we’ll leave it at
that here.</p>
<p>Note that <code>query</code> is now a <code>String</code> rather than a string slice, because calling
<code>to_lowercase</code> creates new data rather than referencing existing data. Say the
query is <code>&quot;rUsT&quot;</code>, as an example: that string slice doesn’t contain a lowercase
<code>u</code> or <code>t</code> for us to use, so we have to allocate a new <code>String</code> containing
<code>&quot;rust&quot;</code>. When we pass <code>query</code> as an argument to the <code>contains</code> method now, we
need to add an ampersand because the signature of <code>contains</code> is defined to take
a string slice.</p>
<p>Next, we add a call to <code>to_lowercase</code> on each <code>line</code> to lowercase all
characters. Now that we’ve converted <code>line</code> and <code>query</code> to lowercase, we’ll
find matches no matter what the case of the query is.</p>
<p>Let’s see if this implementation passes the tests:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-23: Checking for any value in an environment
variable named <code>IGNORE_CASE</code></span></p>
<p>Here, we create a new variable <code>ignore_case</code>. To set its value, we call the
<code>env::var</code> function and pass it the name of the <code>IGNORE_CASE</code> environment
variable. The <code>env::var</code> function returns a <code>Result</code> that will be the
successful <code>Ok</code> variant that contains the value of the environment variable if
the environment variable is set to any value. It will return the <code>Err</code> variant
if the environment variable is not set.</p>
<p>We’re using the <code>is_ok</code> method on the <code>Result</code> to check whether the environment
variable is set, which means the program should do a case-insensitive search.
If the <code>IGNORE_CASE</code> environment variable isn’t set to anything, <code>is_ok</code> will
return false and the program will perform a case-sensitive search. We don’t
care about the <em>value</em> of the environment variable, just whether it’s set or
unset, so we’re checking <code>is_ok</code> rather than using <code>unwrap</code>, <code>expect</code>, or any
of the other methods we’ve seen on <code>Result</code>.</p>
<p>We pass the value in the <code>ignore_case</code> variable to the <code>Config</code> instance so the
<code>run</code> function can read that value and decide whether to call
<code>search_case_insensitive</code> or <code>search</code>, as we implemented in Listing 12-22.</p>
<p>Let’s give it a try! First, we’ll run our program without the environment
variable set and with the query <code>to</code>, which should match any line that contains
the word “to” in all lowercase:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- to poem.txt
   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0s
     Running `target/debug/minigrep to poem.txt`
Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like that still works! Now, let’s run the program with <code>IGNORE_CASE</code>
set to <code>1</code> but with the same query <code>to</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ IGNORE_CASE=1 cargo run -- to poem.txt
</code></pre>
<p>If you’re using PowerShell, you will need to set the environment variable and
run the program as separate commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">PS&gt; $Env:IGNORE_CASE=1; cargo run -- to poem.txt
</code></pre>
<p>This will make <code>IGNORE_CASE</code> persist for the remainder of your shell
session. It can be unset with the <code>Remove-Item</code> cmdlet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">PS&gt; Remove-Item Env:IGNORE_CASE
</code></pre>
<p>We should get lines that contain “to” that might have uppercase letters:</p>
<!-- manual-regeneration
cd listings/ch12-an-io-project/listing-12-23
IGNORE_CASE=1 cargo run -- to poem.txt
can't extract because of the environment variable
-->
<pre><code class="language-console">Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
</code></pre>
<p>Excellent, we also got lines containing “To”! Our <code>minigrep</code> program can now do
case-insensitive searching controlled by an environment variable. Now you know
how to manage options set using either command line arguments or environment
variables.</p>
<p>Some programs allow arguments <em>and</em> environment variables for the same
configuration. In those cases, the programs decide that one or the other takes
precedence. For another exercise on your own, try controlling case sensitivity
through either a command line argument or an environment variable. Decide
whether the command line argument or the environment variable should take
precedence if the program is run with one set to case sensitive and one set to
ignore case.</p>
<p>The <code>std::env</code> module contains many more useful features for dealing with
environment variables: check out its documentation to see what is available.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="writing-error-messages-to-standard-error-instead-of-standard-output"><a class="header" href="#writing-error-messages-to-standard-error-instead-of-standard-output">Writing Error Messages to Standard Error Instead of Standard Output</a></h2>
<p>At the moment, we’re writing all of our output to the terminal using the
<code>println!</code> macro. In most terminals, there are two kinds of output: <em>standard
output</em> (<code>stdout</code>) for general information and <em>standard error</em> (<code>stderr</code>) for
error messages. This distinction enables users to choose to direct the
successful output of a program to a file but still print error messages to the
screen.</p>
<p>The <code>println!</code> macro is only capable of printing to standard output, so we
have to use something else to print to standard error.</p>
<h3 id="checking-where-errors-are-written"><a class="header" href="#checking-where-errors-are-written">Checking Where Errors Are Written</a></h3>
<p>First, let’s observe how the content printed by <code>minigrep</code> is currently being
written to standard output, including any error messages we want to write to
standard error instead. We’ll do that by redirecting the standard output stream
to a file while intentionally causing an error. We won’t redirect the standard
error stream, so any content sent to standard error will continue to display on
the screen.</p>
<p>Command line programs are expected to send error messages to the standard error
stream so we can still see error messages on the screen even if we redirect the
standard output stream to a file. Our program is not currently well-behaved:
we’re about to see that it saves the error message output to a file instead!</p>
<p>To demonstrate this behavior, we’ll run the program with <code>&gt;</code> and the file path,
<em>output.txt</em>, that we want to redirect the standard output stream to. We won’t
pass any arguments, which should cause an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&gt;</code> syntax tells the shell to write the contents of standard output to
<em>output.txt</em> instead of the screen. We didn’t see the error message we were
expecting printed to the screen, so that means it must have ended up in the
file. This is what <em>output.txt</em> contains:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments
</code></pre>
<p>Yup, our error message is being printed to standard output. It’s much more
useful for error messages like this to be printed to standard error so only
data from a successful run ends up in the file. We’ll change that.</p>
<h3 id="printing-errors-to-standard-error"><a class="header" href="#printing-errors-to-standard-error">Printing Errors to Standard Error</a></h3>
<p>We’ll use the code in Listing 12-24 to change how error messages are printed.
Because of the refactoring we did earlier in this chapter, all the code that
prints error messages is in one function, <code>main</code>. The standard library provides
the <code>eprintln!</code> macro that prints to the standard error stream, so let’s change
the two places we were calling <code>println!</code> to print errors to use <code>eprintln!</code>
instead.</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>

    let config = Config::build(&amp;args).unwrap_or_else(|err| {
        eprintln!(&quot;Problem parsing arguments: {err}&quot;);
        process::exit(1);
    });

    if let Err(e) = minigrep::run(config) {
        eprintln!(&quot;Application error: {e}&quot;);
        process::exit(1);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-24: Writing error messages to standard error
instead of standard output using <code>eprintln!</code></span></p>
<p>Let’s now run the program again in the same way, without any arguments and
redirecting standard output with <code>&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run &gt; output.txt
Problem parsing arguments: not enough arguments
</code></pre>
<p>Now we see the error onscreen and <em>output.txt</em> contains nothing, which is the
behavior we expect of command line programs.</p>
<p>Let’s run the program again with arguments that don’t cause an error but still
redirect standard output to a file, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ cargo run -- to poem.txt &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
<p>We won’t see any output to the terminal, and <em>output.txt</em> will contain our
results:</p>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: output.txt</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Are you nobody, too?
How dreary to be somebody!
</code></pre>
<p>This demonstrates that we’re now using standard output for successful output
and standard error for error output as appropriate.</p>

covered how to perform common I/O operations in Rust. By using command line
arguments, files, environment variables, and the <code>eprintln!</code> macro for printing
errors, you’re now prepared to write command line applications. Combined with
the concepts in previous chapters, your code will be well organized, store data
effectively in the appropriate data structures, handle errors nicely, and be
well tested.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll explore some Rust features that were influenced by functional
languages: closures and iterators.</p>

<p>Thank you for participating in our experiment! We hope you got something useful from our additions. Your participation will help make Rust better for everyone.</p>
<p>This experiment only covers about half of The Rust Programming Language, so you should continue learning with Chapter 13 of the actual book: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-00-functional-features.html">https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-00-functional-features.html</a></p>
